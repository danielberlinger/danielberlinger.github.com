<a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/09/the-pmarca-gu-1.html">Do not plan your career</a>:
“The world is an incredibly complex place and everything is changing all the time. You can’t plan your career because you have no idea what’s going to happen in the future. You have no idea what industries you’ll enter, what companies you’ll work for, what roles you’ll have, where you’ll live, or what you will ultimately contribute to the world. You’ll change, industries will change, the world will change, and you can’t possibly predict any of it. Trying to plan your career is an exercise in futility that will only serve to frustrate you, and to blind you to the really significant opportunities that life will throw your way. Career planning = career limiting. The sooner you come to grips with that, the better.” <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Nice.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I met <a href="http://www.lukemelia.com/blog/archives/2007/10/12/looking-back-on-oxygen/">Luke</a> as I searched for work. I had just been offshored at a previous company, and was looking to continue working toward or in an Agile environment. I replied to a message on the XP board, and shortly, traveled down to  the Market to meet Luke. We did the usual interview stuff, but I felt a connection to a kindred spirit that is usually a good sign. Despite a  lengthy call back process that included an interview with everyone on the team from the CTO down to the newest hire, ultimately, I didn't make it. At the time, I didn't really understand why, but I shrugged my shoulders and moved on.

<p>Many months later, coming off a consulting contract I saw a post from Luke looking for developers for a web project. I gave him a shout, and things worked out. I spent this past winter rebuilding <a href="http://www.babynamer.com/">Babynamer</a>with Evan, my pair, and despite some last minute whatever, the project was completed and went live. Sadly that meant saying goodbye to all these folks who I'd come to appreciate including Gerry, who was in the room at least every two weeks to review the products her teams were creating. That's right, a busy CEO directly approving features, design, and involved in the implementation of her vision for the software.</p>

<p>I was expecting a break and relatively quiet spring and summer and had a couple of smaller projects lined up, when I get a shout from Luke about working on another site. But this time I stuck and I joined the team a month later.</p>

<p>Of course, this being me, the company has been sold, and the future of the team is unclear as I write this, but even if the worst happens and the team evaporates, it's been a very rewarding year and change, and provided tremendous insight into the art of the possible in organizations, and some lasting friends.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://macromates.com/blog/2007/hacking-textmate/#comments">Hacking TextMate</a>: <p>Hans-Jörg Bibiko decided he couldn’t wait for a real scripting API (i.e. allowing you to remote control TextMate) and wrote <code>TMTOOLS</code>, a shell command that works as a mini interpreter where the commands are all TextMate actions.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="http://email.eva.mpg.de/~bibiko/downloads/textmate/tmtoolshelp.html">help file for TMTOOLS here</a> and his latest <a href="http://lists.macromates.com/pipermail/textmate/2007-October/022646.html">mailing list letter about TMTOOLS here</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of hacking, <a href="http://ciaranwal.sh/">Ciarán Walsh</a> (maintainer of the PHP and SQL bundles, and contributor extraordinaire) recently started a blog with several TM hacks, for example to make the project drawer show <a href="http://ciaranwal.sh/2007/10/11/finder-labels-in-the-textmate-project-view">Finder labels</a> or <a href="http://ciaranwal.sh/2007/10/10/svn-plug-in-for-textmate">Subversion status</a>.</p>

<p>Also on his blog is a <a href="http://ciaranwal.sh/2007/10/07/glyph-input-manager">glyph input manager</a> which add the functionality mentioned in the <a href="http://macromates.com/blog/2006/multi-stroke-key-bindings/" title="TextMate Blog » Multi-stroke Key Bindings">multi-stroke key bindings post</a> but which does not require you to remember the arcane multi-stroke key bindings (Leopard users have a look at the <a href="///Developer/Documentation/DocSets/com.apple.ADC_Reference_Library.CoreReference.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/releasenotes/Cocoa/AppKit.html#NSInputManager">release notes</a>).</p>

<p>On his site, but not on his blog, is also a <a href="http://ciaranwal.sh/remate/">ReMate plug-in</a> to disable the auto-updating of the project drawer (the feature that drives people working over network connections insane). Another approach to this problem is by Rob McBroom who recently announced a <a href="http://lists.macromates.com/pipermail/textmate/2007-October/022630.html">Remote Project bundle</a> on the mailing list.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: With the exception of Rob’s bundle, the above is all based on undocumented functionality or using things in ways they were not supposed to be used, i.e. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_innovation" title="User innovation">end user innovation</a>.</p> <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Nice work!]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://drewthaler.blogspot.com/2007/10/zfs-hater-redux.html">Recording Artist: ZFS Hater Redux</a>: MWJ has responded to my last post, Don't Be a ZFS Hater, with a post of their own: You don't have to hate ZFS to know it's wrong for you.

I don't like the point-by-point quote and response format — it's way too much like an old-school Usenet flamewar. So I will simply try to hit the high points of their arguments. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Good stuff. I can tell this. People I trust about this level of systems are really happy about ZFS.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://laughingsquid.com/nine-inch-nails-becomes-a-free-agent-with-no-record-label/">Nine Inch Nails Becomes a Free Agent With No Record Label</a>: Yesterday Trent Reznor wrote an amazing post on the Nine Inch Nails blog stating that he no longer has a record contract and that NIN is now a free agent.

<blockquote>Hello everyone. I’ve waited a LONG time to be able to make the following announcement: as of right now Nine Inch Nails is a totally free agent, free of any recording contract with any label. I have been under recording contracts for 18 years and have watched the business radically mutate from one thing to something inherently very different and it gives me great pleasure to be able to finally have a direct relationship with the audience as I see fit and appropriate. Look for some announcements in the near future regarding 2008. Exciting times, indeed.</blockquote>

This, along with Radiohead’s pay what you want release of their new album “In Rainbows”, are both signs of big changes to come in the record industry. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Finally. One of the reasons I left the music business was to learn enough about business to understand the record label model, and why it wasn't working for so many talented folks I met. Then, when it became obvious that the disintermediation that the internet can provide makes it possible for things like the above to occur, it's taken a long time for it to happen with major acts. That's understandable. When a group becomes a break out smash without any help from the old mechanisms, that'll be the next step.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://db.tidbits.com/article/9214">Staff Roundtable: Apple Should Do No Harm to iPhones</a>: Now, I hold no truck with the notion that companies have constitutional rights. That's part of the erosion of personal liberty in favor of so-called corporate rights that began in earnest in the 20th century. (You can read Peachpit Press founder Ted Nace's book <a href="http://www.gangsofamerica.com/">"Gangs of America"</a> on this topic; it's a free download.) But you have to admire the chutzpah that lets a cell carrier assert a constitutionally guaranteed right to prevent choice among its consumers as a matter of "speech."

The <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-07-132A1.pdf">FCC replied in its rule-making on the matter</a>, "To the extent that a choice of device or application implicates First Amendment values at all, we think that our requirements promote rather than restrict expressive freedom because they provide consumers with greater choice in the devices and applications they may use to communicate." Well put - and rather radical in its true conservatism. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Chutzpa doesn't begin to characterize this sort of thing. Which of our presidential candidates has something to say on this issue? I've so much research to do...]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://db.tidbits.com/article/9214">Staff Roundtable: Apple Should Do No Harm to iPhones</a>: Similarly, although Apple apparently attaches no importance to enabling independent applications, users (like Glenn and Joe, and many others) disagree. Apple needs to understand that the iPhone will be a platform whether or not Apple likes it, and managing that process will prove more effective and lucrative than ignoring it (or fighting it, which will just generate bad press). Perhaps Apple should learn from Microsoft, which listened to its customers and will be <a href="http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20070928/vista-downgrades/">selling Windows XP for six months longer than previously announced</a>, due to anemic uptake of Windows Vista. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Not only will Apple lose, but all these appliances can become platforms which can be far greater sources of revenue if only Apple would learn from its past. All sorts of folks can use these things as appliances and enjoy the Jobsian experience. Others can hack and add all sorts of stuff, and make these devices what they want. Jobs has to learn to let go.]</cite> <br />

The 24" iMac weighs 25.4 lbs.I decided to go with the beefier model, but now that I see how industrial-strength they are, I might go with the lighter model if I were to do it again.

<a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/09/boring-rant.html">The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs: A boring rant</a>: The producers of content don't like the TV network system but can't quite see the way across the divide into my digital world. Some musical artists, like Prince, are figuring it out, but they're isolated examples. Trust me, however, when I tell you that TV and movie people will figure it out too. These are not stupid people. And they are not un-greedy. Which means their desire for more money and more control and more freedom will lead them to apply their energy into figuring out how to get out of the plantation the TV networks have created for them. They will break free. Mark my words.  <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Er umm I may be on the wrong side of this issue all things considered... bring change from within?]</cite>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="entry"> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/goodexperience/~3/193396089/2007_12.php">The power of involving stakeholders (and checklists)</a>:Here's a great <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/10/071210fa_fact_gawande?printable=true">New Yorker piece</a> about the power of the simple checklist in saving lives. Peter Pronovost, based at Johns Hopkins, is on a mission to improve health care by having medical staff use a checklist when doing simple actions like inserting a tube.There are many Good Experience themes here - simplicity, empathy, listening, "the basics," measuring success,... but for the moment, I'll point out that Pronovost's success came in part from <em>involving decisionmakers</em> directly in the process. Quoting, emphasis mine:<blockquote>Pronovost had been canny when he started. In his first conversations with hospital administrators, he didn't order them to use the checklists. Instead, he asked them simply to gather data on their own infection rates. ... each hospital assigned a project manager to roll out the checklists and participate in a twice-monthly conference call with Pronovost for trouble-shooting. Pronovost also insisted that each participating hospital <strong>assign to each unit a senior hospital executive, who would visit the unit at least once a month, hear people's complaints, and help them solve problems.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>The executives were reluctant. They normally lived in meetings worrying about strategy and budgets. They weren't used to venturing into patient territory and didn't feel that they belonged there. In some places, they encountered hostility. But their involvement proved crucial.</blockquote>The project was a big success for all the hospitals that participated.Involve the stakeholders! This is exactly what I wrote about years ago in <a href="http://www.goodexperience.com/blog/archives/000024.php">The Most Important User Experience Method</a>. <a href="http://www.goodexperience.com/blog/archives/2007_12.php#comments" title="The power of involving stakeholders (and checklists)">Comments (0)</a>Comments on this Entry:<cite class="dRemark" title="Daniel's remark...">[—]</cite>Source: <a href="http://www.goodexperience.com/blog/">Good Experience Blog</a>]]></content:encoded>

Patronage, scarcity and souvenirs</a>: <blockquote>No, the future of books lies in amateur authors, together with the few superstars with a big enough tribe or a big enough reputation to earn significant advances and royalties. (And yes, a ‘middle class’ of authors with a big enough tribe to make a living, but nowhere near what it takes to make it big.) The big middle, though, the writers who earned enough on tolls–those guys are in big trouble long term. As Esther Dyson predicted fifteen years ago, they are going to have to become troubadors again, traveling, selling live events, doing speeches, etc.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[And the music business from the musician's perspective has gone the same way. All the working musicians I know who are not stars (I know a couple) are troubadors. This applies to all the creatives. Lots of cameras, music, and reading material everywhere. It affects all of us.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.scottkelby.com/blog/2007/archives/636#comments">An Easier Path to HDR Photos</a>: In the example shown above (photos by Barney Streit); the top photo is the regular correct exposure for the building, which was shot in direct harsh mid-day sun. The bottom photo is the HDR image which displays a much broader dynamic range. That image was processed in Photomatix Pro, from nine separate photos (all shot on a tripod), each with a different exposure (bracketed in the camera) to capture the full range from the darkest possible shadows to the brightest highlights.
<p>You can download a trial version from the Photomatix Pro Web site (<a href="http://www.hdrsoft.com/" target="_blank"><strong>click here</strong></a>), and <a href="http://www.photoshopuser.com/members/portfolios/view/gallery/797815" target="_blank">here&#8217;s a link</a> to Barney&#8217;s NAPP online portfolio, where you can see more of his HDR work. My thanks for Barney for the use of his images, and for turning me on to this very cool program.</p>

<a href="http://duncandavidson.com/archives/614#comments">Harman Matte FB Paper</a>: When I ask which one they prefer, the answer is unanimous. They prefer the Harman Matte FB to the other papers. It’s not even close.

Harman Matte FB was released earlier this year, but it’s not the only entry in this latest round of new papers. More recently introduced is Harman Gloss FB AL, a baryta paper with an alumina coating, and Hahnemüehle FineArt Baryta 325. Both of these papers have been extremely well reviewed. As well, Epson is kicking in with their new Epson Exhibition Fiber Paper, a paper that’s supposed to match traditional air dried F surface photographic paper and have an incredible dMax. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[More paper...]</cite> <br />

For some reason, people in the AtomPub community don&rsquo;t seem to like RSD (only <a href="http://www.sixapart.com">Six Apart</a> puts Atom endpoints in RSD).

<p>Hmmm.&#160; When I <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2002/12/13/RFC-Really-Simple-Discoverability">looked at RSD</a> nearly five years ago, it didn&rsquo;t seem so bad.&#160; In any case, here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5213">ticket</a> and a <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/5213/atom-autodiscovery.patch">patch</a> to get WordPress to support autodiscovery of AtomPub endpoints.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Here, here! And the peasants rejoiced! And the reason one (influential) person in the Atom community didn't like RSD wasn't for technical reasons, but because Dave Winer is an acquaintance, and an early supporter of RSD... and he was reviled by some members of that community. Anyway, all these years later, RSD is quietly doing its job, and should be employed for this purpose. That was kinda the point, with no preference for one API over another. Thanks Sam!]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/650-ask-37signals-how-to-go-from-clients-to-products">Ask 37signals: How to go from clients to products?</a>:37signals made the move from clients to products one day at a time. Basecamp was developed alongside client work and was treated as essentially a third client. It had to compete for resources on equal footing with other clients, which meant that every hour we spent on it had to really count.


	<p>With constrained resources, you realize the value of the marginal hour very quickly. You can&#8217;t just goof around with science projects, open-ended explorations, and play time with new whiz-bang technology. Instead, you have to deliver real value, real soon. Otherwise the project is simply going to languish as it loses out to the &#8220;real work&#8221; of paying clients.</p>


	<p>For us, that meant we had to build something for ourselves, something we needed, and something that was valuable enough that we&#8217;d assign resources to it over getting billable hours done. It meant <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch06_Race_to_Running_Software.php">racing to running software</a>, deciding that a lot of stuff <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_It_Just_Doesnt_Matter.php">just doesn&#8217;t matter</a>, and <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Half_Not_Half_Assed.php">building half, not half-assed</a>.</p>


	<p>The initial start of extreme resource starvation lead to many of <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">our thoughts on software development</a>. It also lead me to believe that the best work is done when there&#8217;s not enough time, not enough money to do it &#8220;right&#8221;.</p>


	<p>Doing it right is a pie in the sky. It&#8217;s a misnomer for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">second-system syndrome</a> and it&#8217;s never going to happen anyway. So stop aiming for perfect, start aiming for good enough.</p> <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Always a good reminder.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://db.tidbits.com/article/9244">TidBITS Blog Post: The Best (and Worst) of Leopard</a>: Quick Look and Cover Flow. Together, these offer file previews on steroids. They're utterly silly ("waste cycles drawing trendy animated junk" was my first thought) until you need them, and then they are just terrific. Being able to flip through a bunch of music or photo files looking for the right one, right in the Finder without starting up any other application, is really great.
Spotlight, Spotlight everywhere. Unfortunately, Apple doesn't mention what I think is the most important change to Spotlight, so I'm not allowed to tell you what it is. Suffice it to say that previously I didn't like Spotlight very much, and now I do, so obviously they must have changed the thing about it that I didn't like, right? Plus, I will now be able to search the past! With Safari, I can search for Web pages I've viewed, using whatever text within those pages I happen to remember. With Time Machine, I can search for files that no longer exist. Now if I can just find that $20 bill I had a week ago. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[It should be good stuff... looking forward to it.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2007/10/24/twitter-as-a-utility-service">Twitter as a Utility Service</a>: Evan, focus on reliability, at least until jokes dry up. Twitter has implementation flaws you need to flush out. Don't just leave it to someone to handle it somehow while you enjoy the creamy part of engineering. Did you know that Twitter client developers are abandoning condition GET because Twitter servers frequently lies? Fixing just that problem (and letting developers know so they can return to using conditional GET) will reduce server load significantly. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Interesting.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.bricklin.com/gestures.htm">Gestures, the iPhone, and Standards: A Developer's Questions</a>: Who will step forward with that leadership and be followed? Will Apple try to maintain a sole position as a platform or will it encourage the whole industry to follow its lead? Will Microsoft go the Open route, and follow its previous examples evangelizing XML and other very open standards, or will it try to create its own proprietary following? Will some members of the academic or FOSS community do the legal legwork, interface design, and initial coding to mimic the success of the Berners-Lee and later the W3C vs. proprietary systems such as those from AOL, CompuServe, and Microsoft? Who will fund that? Google? Nokia? Will there be inward-looking greed or industry leadership? <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Good stuff.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RidingRails/~3/174914886/microplace-launches">MicroPlace Launches</a>: <a href="http://www.microplace.com">MicroPlace</a>, a site that lets you make small loans to workers in developing countries and receive a return, just recently launched.  Josh Susser, one of the contractors that worked on it, <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2007/10/24/microplace-launch">wrote a great introduction to the project</a>.


	<blockquote>
		<p>“As far as I am aware, MicroPlace is the first <span class="caps">SEC</span>-registered online brokerage implemented in Ruby on Rails. We had to go through an extensive security audit, and there were a lot of regulatory requirements for us to meet… But the bottom line is that we didn’t have any significant problems with either Ruby or Rails in passing those hurdles.”</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Josh also mentioned that MicroPlace is owned by eBay, making this the first Rails project at an otherwise all-Java shop.  Awesome, high-fives all around guys.  I hope to see more posts about the development aspect of the site.</p>

<a href="http://talideon.com/weblog/2007/10/rsd-rnc.cfm">A RELAX NG compact schema for RSD - talideon.com</a>: I was feeling a bit bored last night and decided to write a schema for RSD in RELAX NG compact syntax. RSD is about five years old at this point, and nobody ever seems to have got around to writing one, so this might help somebody who wanted to make sure they’re producing valid RSD files...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sooo <a href="http://spoken.phrasewise.com/articles/2007/02/27/creating-custom-events-with-seth">you might remember</a> that I happily refactored a site to use <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/articles/web-tech/custom_events.html">Seth's</a> custom javascript events. (I believe they have since been wound into <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">prototype core</a>, if you're going to implement them now.) Anyway, recently we had a number of changes that needed to tie into various user actions, and since they were already custom events from back in February, creating the new classes and having them listen to the events, or in one case adding a new event to a pre-existing class and it's subclasses took almost no time. I love when that happens. Thanks Seth!]]></content:encoded>

Actually, the custom events stuff that is built in to Prototype 1.6 is quite a bit different than what I produced independently. Still works, but we focused quite a bit more on being able to reliably produce custom built-in events like click. (Though it does also support custom events like what I had done.)

But what I did was good enough for Apple. They're using it all over their site! (Originally they were using it only in the iphone sub-site.) Sure wish they had at least said "thanks," though. :-)

It's a beta, but in my opinion, beta in filesystems are solid. This isn't... yet. First off, I've had about 20 panicks in the last 8 hours of running it. Not good. This alone means it is alpha to me.

<a href="http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20071029/apple-destroyed-music-business/">Jackass of the Week: NBC Universal’s Jeff Zucker</a>: NBC Universal chief Jeff Zucker claims Apple &#8220;destroyed the music business in terms of pricing&#8221;. As John Paczkowski points out, the going rate for digital downloads pre-iTunes was zero. Zero.

<p>So while they sit around until hell freezes over waiting for Apple to voluntarily just start sharing iPod hardware profits with entertainment companies for no good reason whatsoever, that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re going to get for video now, too: zero.</p>

People can carry my self produced content just as easily as any other... and other ways to fund shows (including more creative use of limited funds) and recordings means that "networks" and "labels" are reduced to nothing more than a form of VC funding for creative folks, and therefore are not necessary and are terribly limiting in most cases. The internet has disintermediated their ass. The sooner they understand that and find ways to become an open conduit for the exchange of ideas, the better off they'll fair long term.

Some kids with an HD camcorder and iMac are going to produce a film that blows the world away, and it's not going to be shown on a network until after "everyone" has seen it. It's only a matter of time.]]></wp:comment_content>

<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/sethsmainblog/~3/178169252/the-greatest-ma.html">We accidentally marketed ourselves into a corner</a>: First, I'd figure out how to teach parents to understand what really matters and what doesn't about time spent in high school and the choice of a college. Second, I'd push for every selective college to share one application and do a draft similar to the one they do for medical residencies. Every applicant ranks the schools they'd like to attend, in order. Every school considers all the applications, grabs the students they'd love to have in priority order, puts the rest into the "good enough" pile and lets a computer sort em all out as pareto optimally as possible. At least kids will go into their twenties correctly blaming a computer instead of mistakenly blaming themselves. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I thinking about a lot of these isues as we search for Noah's second school (that's right, second school and he's 2.5 years old. <strong>Don't</strong> get me started... sigh.]</cite> <br />

This led to an insane amount of effort optimizing the code to reduce the number of allocations in core code paths. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[More good info in the article and links.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://markbernstein.org/NeoVictorian.html">Mark Bernstein: NeoVictorian Computing</a>: This isn't working. We've been stuck for years, the backlog never goes away, and we fight the same old fights with a new generation of management. The Enterprise is too complex, too turbulent, too confused, to be a fruitful place to study the craft of software. We don't know when it's right. Yes, we sometimes know when it's wrong, when we can't even deliver the software. But what is success? Praise from a self-interested manager? An incremental improvement in corporate throughput? A pile of surveys filled in by our students? A nice writeup in The Journal?

I propose that enterprise software is a hard problem that we can understand only after we solve an easier case, one that lies close to hand. Before we can tackle the enterprise, we need to write software for people. Not software for everyone, but software for you and for me. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Awesome piece. Not to be missed.]</cite>

The other, which I admit might be there somewhere but I don't know where, is a hook so that I can push some subset of a post to twitter or some other service with a link (either the newly created link from the post, or a link from within the post) kinda like what NNW does with Twitter, but on the other side. There might, ahem, be a service I'd like to talk to at that point, cough, cough. Too early to tell...]]></wp:comment_content>

As for the hooks - it's like on my "dream feature" list ;) I will get to it one of these days. The ability to offer generic scripted actions before and after a post goes to the server will I think fill in a lot of feature gaps for people.

I know ads are big business, but no one is interested in interruption based ads anymore, if they ever were. The entrenched thinking that is forcing ads into the process (again) is wrong. The question is not "how can we shove ads down their throats, we love ads" it's "how can we make money from this now that the 'network' is not relevant." An example old school ads that work are product placement. Work defined as, I may or may not care what phone, car, cereal, shoes, etc. folks in the movie are wearing, but I may, so especially in an online download, make sure that metadata is there, and feel free to track the click, and make some money from it.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LessIsBetter/~3/180254188/ironruby-on-sil.html">IronRuby on Silverlight at RubyConf</a>: This is one of the first (to my knowledge) examples of a code-first Silverlight 1.1 application. Most Silverlight applications that generate UIs do so by creating a XAML string that they feed to the XAML parser. When you have a language as beautiful as Ruby, it's a shame to be creating trees via strings. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Nice!]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://apple20.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2007/11/05/the-mythical-gphone/">The Mythical Gphone</a>: 
<p>Did we get a Google phone? No.</p>
<p>What we got instead was a <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/20071105_mobile_open.html">press release</a>, a conference call, some self-indulgent videos, and a <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/11/wheres-my-gphone.html">memo</a> from Andy Rubin, the putative designer of the mythical phone (and hero of an adoring profile in <em>The New York </em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/technology/04google.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all"><em>Times</em></a> over the weekend), confirming what the naysayers have been saying all along: Google is not and will not be in the business of building phones.</p>
<p>What it&#8217;s offering &#8212; and trying to sell to the people who actually build the phones &#8212; is an operating system and some tools for writing cellphone applications.  It&#8217;s a worthy enterprise and I wish them well. What it is not &#8212; as they are the first to say &#8212; is a Gphone.</p>

<pre>Blue Hydrangea

Like the green that cakes in a pot of paint,
these leaves are dry, dull and rough
behind this billow of blooms whose blue
is not their own but reflected from far away
in a mirror dimmed by tears and vague,
as if it wished them to disappear again
the way, in old blue writing paper,
yellow shows, then violet and gray;

a washed-out color as in children's clothes
which, no longer worn, no more can happen to:
how much it makes you feel a small life's brevity.

But suddenly the blue shines quite renewed
within one cluster, and we can see
a touching blue rejoice before the green.

Rainer Maria Rilke
William H. Gass, trans.</pre>
<a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/whats_unspoken_between_us.html">Joho the Blog: What's unspoken between us</a>: Look at how much isn’t said in that line. We wash clothes, and they become more our own as they lose their color. That’s something we know implicitly. We know that clothes need washing.

The next line makes explicit that Rilke is thinking of clothing folded and put away for a child who has grown. Rilke is giving us increasing degrees of explicitness. Poet has to get this right. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Ambient, unspoken knowledge has been an ongoing exploration of mine for many years. More...

<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/05/opensocial-hacked-again/#comments">OpenSocial Hacked Again</a>: He’s pulled up Ning co-founder Marc Andreessen’s friend list to prove his point, and shared part of it with me. I won’t be publishing it here, but it shows that he got access to the application.

Total time to hack iLike on Ning: 20 minutes.

As with the RockYou/Plaxo hack, no real damage has been done, but it shows that in the rush to get applications out the door quickly, attention to security may have fallen by the side of the road. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Oops]</cite> <br />

It's the perfect introduction for people who, perhaps, have an idea of what JRuby is, but who haven't yet tried out any of the Java connectivity. The first page looks at interacting with basic Java libraries / classes, with the second moving on to building a basic Swing-powered GUI app using Java APIs from Ruby code.

<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheSecretDiaryOfSteveJobs/~3/180337608/its-not-phone-its-alliance.html">It's not a phone, it's an alliance</a>: The Journal kind of nails the problem with <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119427874851482602.html?mod=yahoo_hs&amp;ru=yahoo">this story.</a> Money quote: <span style="font-style:italic;">Tech consortia for decades have been notorious for failing to live up to their promise. Google Director of Mobile Platforms Andy Rubin acknowledged the troubled history of previous consortia, but said that Android was different because "we're actually releasing in one week this software." </span>

<p>Finally, has anyone else noticed the way Google is kind of desperately grasping at straws lately? They spend years trying to do something other than search and nothing works. Then, despite their big brains and IQ tests, they get totally blindsided by Facebook and have to gin up this ridiculous OpenSocial thing. Just like with this phone thing, they round up all the losers in that social networking space to form some dumbass alliance. You know how it looks? It looks weak. Companies don't form alliances and consortia when they're winning. Also, whenever you see companies start talking about being "open," it means they're getting their ass kicked. You think Google will be forming an OpenSearch alliance any time soon, to help also-rans in search get a share of the spoils? Me neither.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Nice bitter piece. Good points though.]</cite> <br />

Sues Architect Frank Gehry - New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-MIT-Suit-Architect.html?ex=1352005200&amp;en=912828f3efea7904&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">M.I.T.

<blockquote>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is suing renowned architect Frank Gehry, alleging serious design flaws in the Stata Center, a building celebrated for its unconventional walls and radical angles.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The school asserts that the center, completed in spring 2004, has persistent leaks, drainage problems and mold growing on its brick exterior. It says accumulations of snow and ice have fallen dangerously from window boxes and other areas of its roofs, blocking emergency exits and causing damage.</blockquote>

<p>Maybe unfair, but one interpretation: award-winning "radical" designs aren't great if they can't keep snow off the emergency exit.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[There are all sorts of stories about famous architects and there rejoinders to complaints about leaky roofs... Frank Lloyd Wright they claim told one client who was complaining about a roof leak dripping on his chair to move his chair. Another comment was that you wouldn't know it was a roof if it didn't leak. It's simple really, it's just a question of priority. If you want something that amazes by its design and look it's going to require trying new materials and techniques. If you're trying to build stuff you haven't built before, there is going to be a learning curve, and unexpected results. It's the same thing that makes so many software projects "grow", or "late", or "overbudget". Stick with stuff that's been done many times before and it won't leak or drop melting ice in front of doorways. But it won't inspire or delight except in its utility. Fine if that's what you want, but you don't hire Gehry for that.]</cite> <br />

	<p>The piece that has been opensourced "includes the typical set of Ajax UI components that are now available from several vendors, but goes beyond the standard offering with support for very large datasets, metadata management, advanced skinning and branding, WSDL/SOA binding, and many other features</p>
	<p>Extensions to SmartClient LGPL, including the SmartClient Java Server, the SmartClient Visual Builder tool, and several industry-specific optional modules, continue to be available for purchase."</p>

<a href="http://blog.oppositionallydefiant.com/post/Argotic-Syndication-Framework-20073-Released.aspx">Argotic Syndication Framework 2007.3 Released</a>: I am proud to announce the latest release of the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Argotic/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx">Argotic Syndication Framework</a>. This release provides ASP.NET developers with built-in support for some of the most common syndication features web sites utilize when publishing syndicated content. The framework now provides both server and client support of the Pingback and Trackback peer-to-peer notification protocols, as well as server and client support for  the XML-RPC communication protocol. Several ASP.NET web controls have been provided to make implementing automatic discovery of Pingback, Trackback, and syndication feeds a simple and pain-free process.
New features for this release:

<a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/heroku-an-online-rails-development-and-app-hosting-environment-647.html#comments">Heroku: An Online Rails Development and App Hosting Environment</a>: Martin Sadler of <a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/">WorkingWithRails.com</a> just pointed me towards <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, an exciting new development in the Rails world. Heroku is an online environment where you can develop and host Rails applications.. all from the browser. This is pretty exciting stuff and, on paper, makes rolling out, tweaking, and playing with Rails applications a snap. Rather than blather on about how this could become a game-changer in the Web applications industry, instead I'll point you to Heroku's own <a href="http://heroku.com/features">excellent set of screencasts and feature tours</a>.
<p>Adam Wiggins, one of the three partners behind Heroku, has some more "from the trenches" detail in <a href="http://adam.blogs.bitscribe.net/2007/11/08/farewell-and-hello/">this post</a> on his personal blog.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://www.lukemelia.com/blog/archives/2007/11/12/chris-donnan-on-agile-and-humilty/">Luke says</a>: <p>At one point in his writeup, Chris notes that this was the &#8220;YEARS MOST IMPORTANT deliverable for many, many people&#8221;. This is a big neon warning sign. Part of the strategy of iterative delivery in Scrum is to avoid this situation. In a well-functioning scrum organization, releases are a non-event. In fact, Jeff Sutherland was recently telling Ken and I about his weekly releases at PatientKeeper, where there is little fanfare, just an automated deployment, and if the phone doesn&#8217;t ring from the customer, the release was a success.</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons why iterative delivery might not have been viable in Chris&#8217; particular situation, of course. Still, when a situation causes you to re-evaluate your approach to building software, it&#8217;s a good idea to look again at the decisions where you strayed from the ideal and ask yourself what you can do differently moving forward. </p> <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[My addition: One of the reason's for "constant releasing" is because releasing is often hard. The only way (IMHO) to make hard things easy is to do them over and over and over again. You slowly (and iteratively) get better at them. In fact, it is a favorite technique of mine for places that can't seem to grasp iterative development. Say something along the lines of "This is really hard and we're not doing it well. We're going to do it once a week (or whatever) until we have it down." After that it'll take care of itself... So while this may not have helped in this situation, which I know next to nothing about, stick in your pocket as a technique for when it can be applied. You'd be surprised how easy it is to get it workin']</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/700-ask-37signals-is-formal-education-important">Ask 37signals: Is formal education important?</a>: What we care about is intelligence, curiosity, passion, character, motivation, taste, intuition, writing skills, and the ability to make smart value judgements. A few of these qualities may benefit from exposure to higher education, but we feel most of them are better learned through practical experience. Further, we don’t believe taste can be taught—you either got it or you don’t. We believe taste is one of the most important qualities in anyone we hire. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Amen.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/making-the-opensocial-api-feel-more-at-home#comments">Making the OpenSocial API feel more at home</a>: <p>Chris Chabot has been doing a lot of experimentation with the new <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial">OpenSocial APIs</a>. He has written up his experience and created two prototype wrappers.</p>
	<p>The first short article has some <a href="http://www.chabotc.com/javascript/first-step-into-the-open-social-world/">general information and background</a>.</p>
	<p>The second article includes the <a href="http://www.chabotc.com/javascript/second-step-into-the-open-social-world/">first library you can tell to load</a> (owner, viewer, ownerFriends and/or<br />
viewerFriends) information, and presents this information in an uniform way (instead of having to do different type of calls for different information fields) and with proper consistent error handling. With it you can very easily create your first OpenSocial container application in a friendly prototype style environment. You can take a direct look at <a href="http://www.chabotc.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/ospeople.js">the library itself</a>. </p>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.chabotc.com/javascript/third-step-into-the-open-social-world/">third article</a> contains a <a href="http://www.chabotc.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/osajax.js">Ajax.Request implementation</a>, since Prototype's version won't work well or even at all in the cross domain environment of open social containers, it allows you to re-use your current Prototype based programs by trying to mimic Prototype's Ajax call as well as possible given the constraints of the situation. Under the hood, <code>_IG_FetchContent</code> is used to talk back to the server.</p>
	<p>It is good to see people take the raw APIs and make them feel more like their library of choice.

<a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=625">CSS 3: A Giant Serving Of FAIL</a>: <p>In my &#8220;<a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=622">Standards Heresy</a>&#8221; talk I noted pretty bluntly that <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work.html">CSS 3</a> is a joke. A sad, sick joke being perpetrated by people who clearly don&#8217;t build actual web apps. If the preponderance of the working group did, we&#8217;d already have useful things like <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/becss">behavioral CSS</a> being turned into recommendations and not turds like <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-css3-namespace-20060828/">CSS namespaces</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-css-print-20061013/">CSS Print Profile</a>. And I&#8217;m not even sure if the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-css3-layout-20070809/">&#8220;Advanced&#8221; Layouts</a> cluster-fsck should be mentioned for the fear that more people might actually look at it. You&#8217;d expect an &#8220;advanced layouts&#8221; module to give us hbox and vbox behaviors or a grid layout model or stretching&#8230;but no, the &#8220;answer&#8221; apparently is <em>ascii art</em>. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-css3-layout-20070809/#rowheight">No, I&#8217;m not making this up</a>.  It&#8217;s sad commentary that you can propose this kind of dreck at the W3C and get taken seriously.</p>
	<p>Beyond what&#8217;s obviously wrong with the avenues being (inexplicably) pursued, there&#8217;s a lot to read into what&#8217;s <em>not</em> being worked on. Namely the serious and myriad problems with the basics of how CSS rules are written and applied.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[We were discussing this just yesterday...

<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/sethsmainblog/~3/185208535/the-8-billion-s.html">The $8 billion story/scam</a>: Last year, more than $8,000,000,000 was wasted on these cards. Not in the value spent, but in fees and breakage. When you give a card, if it doesn't get used, someone ends up keeping your money, and it's not the recipient. People spent more than eight billion dollars for nothing... buying a product that isn't as good as cash.
<p>If I were a creative non-profit, I'd start marketing alternative gift cards. They would consist of PDF files you could print out and hand over to people when you give them cash. It could say,</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas. Here's your present, go spend it on what you really want. AND, just to make sure we're in the right holiday spirit, I made a donation in your name to Aworthycause."</p>
<p>Stories come and go. It's up to marketers to spread the good ones.</p>

<a href="http://icant.co.uk/articles/seven-rules-of-unobtrusive-javascript/">The seven rules of unobtrusive JavaScript</a>: I've found the following rules over the years developing, teaching and implementing JavaScript in an unobtrusive manner. They have specifically been the outline of a workshop on unobtrusive JavaScript for the Paris Web conference 2007 in Paris, France. I hope that they help you understand a bit why it is a good idea to plan and execute your JavaScript in this way. It has helped me deliver products faster, with much higher quality and a lot easier maintenance. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Good stuff.]</cite>

<a href="http://scottstuff.net/blog/articles/2007/10/16/zfs-and-the-holy-grail-of-storage">ZFS and The Holy Grail of Storage</a>: <p>I&#8217;ve wanted that for years, but I&#8217;ve largely dismissed it as a pipe dream, because it doesn&#8217;t fit cleanly into the drive/RAID/LVM/filesystem model that everything uses.  The only thing that I&#8217;ve seen that even comes close is <a href="http://www.drobo.com/">Drobo</a>, and it&#8217;s supposedly fairly slow and really just too &#8220;magic&#8221; for me to trust.</p>
<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Even this isn't what I really want... although the Drobo seems nice. I want the same sort of thing, but I want to two pools... one for the time machine backups and one for the "live boot image" type backup. I admit that in some cases that might be overkill, but not for business related stuff. I admit that it wouldn't take long because of the "virtual nature" of so many apps to go from blank machine or disk to up and running (all my code is in repositories, schedule, mail and stuff is on the web etc., but still) but I keep a fairly up to date back up anyway, because if the failure occurs near a deadline (and doesn't it always? Praise Murphy!) I don't really want to be mucking about with that, I just want to get things done. Anyway, having two per machine would make it easy to have both, and having one hardware device that could do that or more would make it easier to manage. In the meantime the individual hard drives are piling up... I should add that a pair of Drobo's per machine seems costly to me... Other suggestions?]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Two things worth noting:

<pre>def something(x = 0)
  ...
end</pre>


doesn't ensure that x is set to a value of zero, because the method could be called with nil [something(nil)] so to ensure a default value of zero even in the face a call with nil

<pre>def something(x = 0)
  x ||= 0
  ...
end</pre>


would do the trick.

The second is that when adding text and an object's property

<pre>x = 'some string'
y = x + something.description</pre>

that if something.description is nil, the addition will fail, but if you interpolate ala

<pre>x = 'some string'
y = x + "#{something.description}"</pre>

something.description evaluates to empty string and therefore won't fail.

Two subtle regressions our tests caught today when refactoring, but were not easy to see in the code.
Onward!]]></content:encoded>

But if the new Browser version don&#8217;t arrive quickly enough, or if they don&#8217;t fully solve the problem of browsers crashing once an hour, then a mass migration to Opera may be the best we can hope for. At worst, content and application producers will opt for more stable non-Ajax alternatives such as Flash or Silverlight.

Next month, cyclists will be happy to see the first of many new public bike-parking shelters popping up near transit hubs throughout the city.

		<title>File sharing OS X Leopard (10.5.1)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems like <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/11/17/howDoYouMountANetworkVolum.html#disqus_thread">some other folks</a> (Hi Dave!) had some trouble with file sharing on Leopard, and so did I. I thought I would just write up what I learned, and maybe it'll help someone else.

In System Preferences -&gt; Sharing -&gt; File Sharing, I added the disk I wanted to access. I looked at the default permissions and decided they'd work for me. Next, I clicked on the Options... button and clicked on Share files and folders using AFP, which was not selected by default (at least in my case). I clicked on Done.

Next, I went to the other machine that I wanted to aces the newly shared disk, and selected command-k, which has long been the Finder's place for mounting network volumes, and browsed to what I wanted, and everything seems to work.

I had also set the Finder preference to show the disk on the desktop, but I'm not sure that's necessary, it just felt all home-like to this old Mac user.

Anyway, with that out of the way, here's the problem... the consolidation of prefs, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/11/16/netinfo/index.php?pf=1">removal of NetInfo</a>, or whatever improvements were generated by the update are a good thing one there own. But if there is no clear path for older users, if expected behavior is not defaulted for upgrades, than how is someone supposed to know that buried in a optional sheet is stuff that's been standard for ages? Now I'm sure that various combinations of stuff probably caused this stuff to be set the way I expected, but there was no magic playing for my wife's iMac, so it comes at some surprise to me that this stuff wouldn't work out of the box.

The flip side I guess, was how easy screen sharing was out of the box... for me anyway. I'll bet others have different stories though based on the trouble I had getting something as easy as file sharing going. Something that should "just work" didn't, and <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/11/17/the-brand-promise-of-apple/">while it doesn't annoy as much as it does Scoble</a>, or Dave, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/11/17/applesBrandPromiseAndHowBl.html">who had the annoyance</a> of having an app he relies on break (no doubt as he has already noted, a portent of things to come for that app sadly), it still is not what I expect from my Mac experience either.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/11/16/caught-in-apple-restart-hell/#comments">Caught in Apple restart hell</a>: Oh, and if you think I have something against Apple, no I don&#8217;t. But my computer, a 17-inch MacBookPro, has already been in the shop twice. My son&#8217;s MacBookPro 15-inch has been in the shop twice and has a dead USB port now so both of our machines need to go back into the shop.
<p>What&#8217;s ironic is lots of other computer companies would LOVE to give me free stuff (I don&#8217;t take it) but Apple is the only company that&#8217;s never raised a PR finger to help me. Instead I feel so honored to spend my money on this crap. Why? Just to have a shiny machine? </p>
<p>Well, sorry. The shine is wearing off. Screw you Apple.</p> <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I really wish he hadn't mixed these two issues... that of him having problems and the lack of PR love. The second issue shouldn't even be brought up, especially in this context, as it makes it seem like the problem is that Apple's given him no free stuff. Now, as far as problems are concerned, there's nothing more frustrating than a dead machine for most of us who live on one machine and don't have a shelf full of replacements. So I feel his pain as Apple's theme of "It just works" can be annoying, since it doesn't always, and despite an OK track record things still things do go wrong for everyone at times. I wish Apple didn't claim this, since it isn't true, but still, the issues here got mixed beyond my ability to parse them. ]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/11/16/the-serverless-internet-company/#comments">The serverless Internet company</a>: They have about 15,000 people already creating live video channels. They have one of the most innovative Web sites I’ve ever seen.

But they don’t own a server.

How else has the world changed? Where the hell is Microsoft in this whole business? How did Microsoft screw this up so badly? Let’s get this straight. Amazon used to be a book store. Now they are hosting virualized servers for Internet companies. So much for having billions of dollars in the bank like Microsoft does, some of the smartest people in the world working in your research arms and having “monopoly” market share in operating systems. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Wow.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/guykawasaki/Gypm/~3/187311663/amazon-announce.html">Amazon Announced Kindle</a>: You’re going to see two kinds of reviews: bad ones from people who haven’t used it and good ones from people who have. It’s that kind of product—plus Jeff Bezos’s reality-distortion field isn’t as large as Steve Jobs’s. I have used it and if someone gave me a choice of receiving an iPhone or a Kindle, I’d pick the Kindle. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Here's what I don't like... Guy doesn't mention that Truemors is carried before he starts opining (although he does note it with an exclamation point later on). Second he sets you up by saying "bad ones from people who haven’t used it and good ones from people who have." which immediately dismisses the opinion of people who haven't used one as invalid, and further suggests that anyone who has used on has written positively. Wow. No wonder he was a world class evangelist. It's a bit overstyled IMHO. but check out <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/11/19/the-future-of-reading">Mark's take on it</a>, and <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/11/you-wont-find-m.html">Seth's</a>. Granted each with their own agenda, but still. My take? It's a digital rights issue. BigCo's are always trying to grab them and give nothing in return. Not such a good thing. I'm trying to teach my son right now that it's OK to give away toys he doesn't play with anymore. Same for his books. How does this lesson fit into these corporate interests? Not.]</cite> <br />

There is. P2P is probably the least efficient means of distributing content in the last mile. Comcast, Time Warner, etc should charge a premium to those users who want to act as a seed and relay for P2P traffic. After all, that is why P2P is used, right ? For content distributors to avoid significant bandwidth and hosting charges. That makes it commercial traffic far more often than not. So make them pay commercial rates. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Hmmm, a different perspective.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~3/187836066/spiralfrog_looses.php">SpiralFrog Loses $3m in 3 months: Not "Getting It" is Getting Expensive</a>: 
That's a whole lot of money to throw away but it shouldn't come as any surprise.  The SpiralFrog model is awful.  Users get free downloads of DRM laden songs that they can listen to in Windows Media Player, but they have to periodically answer survey questions and view ads in order to for the songs to continue playing.  The site itself looks like one big ad with music appended to it. 
<p>
For a totally different take on free music downloads as an ad supported business, see <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/rcrd_lbl_goes_live.php">our coverage</a> of Peter Rojas's startup <a href="http://rcrdlbl.com">RCRD LBL</a>.  RCRD LBL is hardly a dream come true, either, but it sure leaves SpiralFrog in the dust.

<p>We&rsquo;ll get to the practicum in just a moment but first, let&rsquo;s talk &mdash; very briefly &mdash; about some super basic UX tenets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be nice to your users and customers (and potential customers).</li>
<li>Design as if your main goal is to inform and educate.</li>
<li>Be honest and forthcoming, while you&rsquo;re at it.</li>
<li>Help your users and customers to do what they want, not what you want them to do.</li>
<li>Be consistent with your message and quality of service (and I&rsquo;m including software design here, folks).</li>
<li>Scientific, measurable &ldquo;usability&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make for a good experience.</li>
<li>Good design makes people feel good.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/vitaminmasterfeed/~3/152008441/social-networks-arent-products">Social Networks Aren't Products</a>: On launch day, I found that traffic was very strong, but hardly anybody was signing up. I literally got more e-mails from people saying "what a great site!" than I actually got sign-ups. Same for the following few days. So I decided to try an experiment. I put up a preview screen saying we were taking sign-ups and allowing customers to build their profiles, but I hid the page that allowed site visitors to browse other profiles. In this way, nobody was able to see how many (or, more accurately, how few) other members of the site there were at the time. The next day, sign-ups multiplied by several staggering orders of magnitude.

I learned from this experiment early on a lesson that would repeat itself for the next two years: a social network isn't a product as such. Rather, the product that a social network provides is access to a large pool of other people. Every social network, whether it be a subscription-based dating site or an advertising-funded general community, must grapple with this ineluctable fact. It's what makes the rules for social networks different from utility applications like Basecamp and BlinkSale.

If a new member signs up for Highrise today, she can use the application, put in some contacts, appreciate the app's interface and functionality directly and, if she likes it, leave a happy paying customer. Highrise with one customer is a product with one happy client who might just become an evangelist to others. On the other hand, a social network with one customer, even if it were infinitely better than MySpace in every regard, is a company with one bored and angry customer, which is to say: an utter failure. In the taxonomy of Web applications, social and utility applications are entirely different species. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Excellent grounded story.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2007/11/26/making-rules-ii/#comments">Making Rules, II</a>: What matters is the first point. (Forgive me, but the others are red herrings, even if you’re an entrepreneur hoping to make money on the advertising gravy train.) Facebook crossed a line here. They lured us into a vast stockyard, and then began to monetize us in ways that violated our quaint notion that we are not in fact cattle.

Treating users of free services like cattle is as old as TV, radio and billboards. It may be as old as people painting in caves with charcoal and spit. The difference now isn’t in Facebook’s manners, which are no different than those of NBC or the New York Times. The difference isn’t even that this time it’s personal. That’s been a holy grail for advertising since the beginning as well. Facebook is reaching for a golden ring here, and I’m inclined to forgive them for doing that. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[A must read about marketplaces and understanding our role in it (or what our role should be).]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For those of us of the tech world a couple of useful items that I can't find. Maybe there out there, in which case I hope you folks can point me to them...

1) A decent sized screen (7 - 9 inches) with a couple of speakers that I can attach to an iPod (preferably wirelessly), to play video. Please no fancy switches on the front, or other enticements for little fingers or feet. The screen should be able to display behind the front seat headrest, preferably from a nice strong bracket rather than straps of some sort. It should cost something reasonable rather than twice the cost of an iPod. Alternate uses, a portable system for displaying presentations, or catching up on various bits of, ahem, culture.

2) A small something that I can insert/stick on/into his favorite toy or whatever that sounds an alarm when that small item gets more than a few feet away from the unit in my pocket, with a distance setting. A couple of common scenarios... Kid in stroller, falling asleep, grip loosening on favorite toy. Toy falls out of stroller quietly so parents don't notice who then frantically have to search for it later... Or on a sneaker which someone's child loves to remove... etc. Should work on bottles and other stuff, although I understand the range issues here may prove difficult. Let's see though, OK? Alternate uses for this include not forgetting or losing keys, wallets, phones. etc.

Lemme know?

Thanks.]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/blasting-the-myth-of">Blasting the Myth of the Fold - Boxes and Arrows: The design behind the design</a>: Stop worrying about the fold. Don’t throw your best practices out the window, but stop cramming stuff above a certain pixel point. You’re not helping anyone. Open up your designs and give your users some visual breathing room. If your content is compelling enough your users will read it to the end.

Advertisers currently want their ads above the fold, and it will be a while before that tide turns. But it’s very clear that the rest of the page can be just as valuable – perhaps more valuable – to contextual advertising. Personally, I’d want my ad to be right at the bottom of the TMZ page, forget the top.

The biggest lesson to be learned here is that if you use visual cues (such as cut-off images and text) and compelling content, users will scroll to see all of it. The next great frontier in web page design has to be bottom of the page. You’ve done your job and the user scrolled all the way to the bottom of the page because they were so engaged with your content. Now what? Is a footer really all we can offer them? If we know we’ve got them there, why not give them something to do next? Something contextual, a natural next step in your site, or something with which to interact (such as a poll) would be welcome and, most importantly, used. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Nice report.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/11/26/theNextStepInDiggClones.html">The next step in Digg clones</a>: Imagine Digg in the old days, when there were just 25 people using it. Maybe that wasn't enough. Maybe it didn't really get interesting until there were 100 users or 250 or 1000. It was good, the articles were gems, things we weren't finding on our own, there were huge numbers of them, but they were prioritized, and the community had a heart of gold, people were doing it for love. The maturity level was high.
<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[A friend and I were discussing a very similar idea, so I'd toss the following into the fire. Create an API for the blog readers that "marks" a story as highly rated by your community.

<a href="http://broadstuff.com/archives/553-US-A-List-bloggers-start-to-line-up-against-Facebook.html">US A-List bloggers start to line up against Facebook?</a>: The thing about this is that these sort of guys are pretty influential - of these things are tipping points made. 

Last year we predicted that 2007 would be the year that Privacy really hit the headlines, though we never believed Facebook would be the catalyst - my money was on Google or some small rapacious startup. Facebook was then a very benign player.

How things change....now, on the one hand, we have a desperate-to-monetize-at-$15bn company with (observably) less humble management, on the other a mounting storm in the blogosphere, increasing legal/regulatory interest, and early reports from customers about being caught by their friends with their wallets open being less than happy! <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Hmmm.]</cite></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/RubyInject">RubyInject</a> is an intriguing new tool that can "inject" a Ruby interpreter into any running OS X application. Why? Well, along with RubyCocoa it allows you to interact with an application "from the inside." If you're a RubyCocoa aficionado you can probably think of a few cute tricks to use this for already. If not, then just think about AppleScript on acid. All of this fun and games does require OS X 10.5 (Leopard), however.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Hmmm.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071127-google-hopes-to-undercut-coal-with-cheap-renewable-energy.html">Google hopes to undercut coal with cheap, renewable energy</a>: The company itself is also trying hard to reduce its drain on the environment. Google is working to reduce the energy expenditure of its data centers across the world, all of which need power and cooling for the servers, and plans to be carbon neutral by the end of the current year. It has also been developing an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070329-its-easy-being-green-google-goes-solar.html">array of solar cells</a> to power its California headquarters, the Googleplex, and is involved in an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070612-meet-the-climate-savers-major-tech-firms-launch-war-on-energy-inefficient-pcs.html">initiative</a> to arrive at more energy-efficient computers.

Presumably, the idea behind this move is as follows: if you can't persuade people that burning coal is a bad idea ecologically, providing them with a cheaper, cleaner alternative makes it more expensive to pollute than not, and even if shareholders don't care about the trees, they'll care about the bottom line. At a time when report after report highlights the growing damage done to the planet through the use of fossil fuels, this move by Google to spur renewable energy uptake ought to be applauded.

<a href="http://www.9to5mac.com/appletv-where-are-therentals-34235859#comments">Apple, where are the rentals?</a>: <p>Over the past few weeks, the studio bosses have been reversing course and praising apple again.&nbsp; Warner Chief, Edgar Bronfman recently <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/music_industry_starting_to_come_around">got caught praising Apple's iPhone and iPod lines</a>.&nbsp; Jon Gruber at <a href="http://www.daringfireball.com">Daring Fireball</a> reports on&nbsp; <a href="http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/magazine/15-12/mf_morris?currentPage=all">Doug Morris</a>' admission that the Entertainment industry had/has no idea what they are doing technology-wise.&nbsp; In fact they were so stupid that they couldn't even know who was smart enough to hire to figure it out.&nbsp; That is Calculus Integral stupid - and it seems about right. Quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;There's no one in the record industry that's a technologist,&quot; Morris explains. &quot;That's a misconception writers make all the time, that the record industry missed this. They didn't. They just didn't know what to do. It's like if you were suddenly asked to operate on your dog to remove his kidney. What would you do?&quot;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Personally, I would hire a vet. But to Morris, even that wasn't an option. &quot;We didn't know who to hire,&quot; he says, becoming more agitated. &quot;I wouldn't be able to recognize a good technology person &mdash; anyone with a good bullshit story would have gotten past me.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2007/11/29/nycs-flawed-traffic-plan-brought-to-you-by-toyota/#comments">CBS 2's award-winning political reporter</a> tells us that &quot;Londoners are now cloning license plates to avoid congestion fees&quot; (note they're not copying license plates -- they're cloning them. Terrifying). She doesn't tell us how widespread the practice is, how many people might be doing it or how it may be impacting a system that has reduced traffic congestion by 70,000 vehicles per day and is raising $250 million a year for mass transit (You'd think it would be easy for an award-winning investigative reporter to find <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/5474.aspx">this sort of information</a>). Rather, Kramer gives some airtime to Westchester obstructionist Assembly member Richard Brodsky, incorrectly referring to him as &quot;head of the Congestion Mitigation Commission.&quot;<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Oy.]</cite> <br />

In November, several hundred people filled the Jewish Community Center in Manhattan to hear <a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2007/11/07/its-not-a-law-of-nature/">Jan Gehl</a>, the Danish urban planner renowned for humanizing the streets of Copenhagen, London and dozens of other cities. Gehl's talk launched the <a href="http://www.nycstreets.org">Upper West Side Streets Renaissance</a>, a campaign to radically reconfigure the streets led by <a href="http://www.transalt.org" target="new">Transportation Alternatives</a>, <a href="http://www.pps.org">the Project for Public Spaces</a> and the <a href="http://topp.openplans.org/new-york-city-streets-renaissance-campaign">Open Planning Project</a>.

Gehl is working as a consultant for the transportation department. With a team of volunteers, he conducted studies of how the streets are used in various parts of the city and made recommendations for supporting “walkability” in public life. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Go, Go!, GO!

<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slash7/rss/~3/192800674/don-t-complain-about-the-game-change-it">Don't complain about the game. Change the game you're playing.</a>: The people who insist on telling you that <em>you can't</em> are often actually saying <em>I can't</em>. For whatever reason: fear, self-doubt, teachers, managers or parents who quash them (whom they let squash them), a complete lack of belief in their own power, a kind of sublimated jealousy and rage because you succeed where, of course, they "can't." 

It's true that this stuff sometimes comes straight from the mouths of people who care (or purport to care) about you, your business, your product, your career, whatever. They may think they're trying to do right by you, but I've found that the people who say such things are afraid of <em>life</em>... not just for themselves, but for you, too. They're afraid you might fail because they're so horribly afraid of failing. They're afraid that you might succeed, too, because what kind of light would that cast on their failure to do exactly what you're doing right?<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Great piece on success, failure, and making stuff happen.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/blog/2007/07/17/why-usability-is-a-path-to-failure/">adaptive path » blog » Todd Wilkens » Why usability is a path to failure</a>: Recently, I’m even coming to believe that focusing on usability is actually a path to failure. Usability is too low level, too focused on minutia. It can’t compel people to be interested in interacting with your product or service. It can’t make you compelling or really differentiate you from other organizations. Or put another way, there’s only so far you can get by streamlining the shopping cart on your website. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Interesting but overly simplistic. Lots of interesting comments.]</cite></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2007/12/06/new-york-times-employees-say-renzo-forgot-the-bike-parking/#comments">New York Times Employees Say Renzo Forgot the Bike Parking</a>: There was just one problem. While the Times and developer Forest City Ratner were promoting their new Renzo Piano-designed skyscraper as a "technologically advanced and environmentally sensitive" exemplar of green construction, a lack of bike parking and policies hostile towards cyclists were discouraging employees from commuting to work by the city's most environmentally-friendly mode of urban transport. 
 <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I have a similar problem in my current location... there's no way to bring a bike into the building, leaving a bike outside all the time is a poor idea. Sad. So little thought to the simple things that improve everyone's life.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/06.html">Where there's muck, there's brass</a>: The one thing that so many of today's cute startups have in common is that all they have is a simple little Ruby-on-Rails Ajax site that has no barriers to entry and doesn't solve any gnarly problems. So many of these companies feel insubstantial and fluffy, because, out of necessity (the whole company is three kids and an iguana), they haven't solved anything difficult yet. Until they do, they won't be solving problems for people. People pay for solutions to their problems. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Nice article.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/sethsmainblog/~3/196664159/monopolies-seve.html">Monopolies, seven years later</a>: The past, the glorious, profit-making, fun past of the media business was based on:
<ul>
<li>scarce creators, under long term contracts</li>
<li>scarce retail outlets, able to be controlled with marketing muscle</li>
<li>scarce spectrum (few radio stations, few TV stations)</li>
<li>copyright laws (and a lack of technology) that limited theft of services</li>
<li>limited power of the creators to compete without a large media company as partner</li></ul>

It's hard to outline a point of view that shows the power of any form of media getting stronger over the next decade. There are going to be more TV channels, not less. More ways for authors to distribute their works, not less. More ways for musicians to connect with listeners, not less. More ways for consumers to sample or take content, not less.

You were a monopolist. You're not anymore. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[On the money, and on my mind.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2007/12/05/cyclist-doored-killed-by-truck-in-midtown/#comments">Cyclist Doored, Killed by Truck in Midtown</a>: Here is the wire report:

FINAL UPDATE,RESP-4 REPORTS A CYCLIST TRAVELING NORTH BOUND 6 AVE BTWN 36 &amp; 37 ST WERE A RED PICK UP TRUCK WAS PARKED BY THE HYDRANT WHEN THE PASSENGER OPENED THE DOOR AND STRUCK THE CYCLIST . THE CYCLIST WAS STRUCK BY A PASSING BOX TRUCK.THE CYCLIST WAS TAKEN TO BELLVUE HOSPITAL {DOA} ..SIGNS &amp; MARKING IN GOOD WORKING ORDER..PER OP-26

And here is how it was reported in the Daily News. Note the number of steps taken, and not taken, by the cyclist to put himself in mortal danger -- starting with the headline.

Bicyclist killed after falling in front of truck
 
A 63-year-old man bicycling in midtown Manhattan Wednesday morning hit a car door and flipped into the street before he was run over and killed by a box truck, police said.

The man, whose identity wasn't immediately released, was not wearing a helmet, a police source said.

It's as if every action -- hitting the door, flipping into the street -- was initiated by the cyclist, who wasn't even wearing a helmet. The drivers of the vehicles, meanwhile, are never mentioned in the story. In fact, the article makes it seem as if there were no drivers.

The Ace Hardware truck that hit the man stayed at the scene. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Perspective is why blogging rules. There's an outlook, a framework through which we all view the occurrences in our lives. Shift the framework and our perspective changes, and so does the way we record the account of a given moment. Because of human nature, all the major papers report news from a similar perspective (in order to become a reporter, editor, etc. requires certain qualities which are self selecting for a given viewpoint.)]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Many developers simply want to store, process, and query their data without worrying about managing schemas, maintaining indexes, tuning performance or scaling access to their data," the documentation explains. "Amazon SimpleDB removes the need to maintain a schema, while your attributes are automatically indexed to provide fast real-time lookup and querying capabilities."

<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/cmp/tc_cmp/storytext/204803008/25561698/SIG=110de09l3/*http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb">SimpleDB</a> costs 14 cents per machine hour, with no minimum fee. This is normalized to the hourly capacity of a 2007 1.7 GHz Xeon processor. There's also a data transfer charge of 10 cents per Gbyte transferred in. For data transferred out, the rate starts at 18 cents per Gbyte for first 10 Tbytes per month, then drops to 16 cents for the next 40 Tbytes per month, and finally drops to 13 cents per Gbyte for 50 Tbytes and beyond per month. These fees apply to data transferred in and out of Amazon SimpleDB. Data transferred between SimpleDB and other Amazon Web services is moved without additional cost. There's also a $1.50 fee per Gbyte per month for the storage of structured data.

There's one significant cost that SimpleDB users can avoid: keeping a database administrator on the payroll.

<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/12/bebo-warmly-welcomes-facebook-developers-with-new-platform/#comments">Bebo Embraces Facebook Apps With Its “Open Applications Platform”</a>: Today, Bebo is announcing the availability of a new platform called the “Open Application Platform”, but it’s not really a new platform. Rather, it’s like a clone of Facebook’s proprietary platform. The idea is to create a platform that matches the functionality and structure of Facebook’s platform so closely that it’s easy to deploy applications built for Facebook on Bebo, with little or no changes to the code.

Bebo’s new platform accepts something called SNQL and SNML (as in, social networking query language and social networking markup language), each of which mirrors Facebook’s FQL and FBML, albeit with subtle differences. CEO Michael Birch says that it has been developing these parallel languages for about five months and in communication with Facebook itself, which has been assisting Bebo in its efforts to essentially adopt its platform. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Brilliant.]</cite> <br />

  <p><strong>DFW:</strong> I guess I, when I was in my twenties, like deep down underneath all the bullshit what I really believed was that the point of fiction was to show that the writer was really smart. And that sounds terrible to say, but I think, looking back, that&#8217;s what was going on. And I don&#8217;t think I really understood what loneliness was when I was a young man. And now I&#8217;ve got a much less clear idea of what the point of art is, but I think it&#8217;s got something to do with loneliness and something to do with setting up a conversation between human beings.</p>

<p>Ruby 1.9 is just around the corner, so it looks like a good time to create a new edition of Programming Ruby. So, I'm pleased to announce that the Third Edition of the PickAxe has just entered beta.</p>

<p>The book's home page is at <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby3">http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby3</a>.</p>

<p>Although 1.9 is largely compatible with 1.8, there are definite differences. And it's been an interesting ride getting the examples in the book to compile and run with the current 1.9 interpreter. The book pushes the envelope in many different areas, and includes example code designed to illustrate edge cases. When I find these, I'm flagging them in the text and (if they look like bugs) adding them to the tracking system. But, so far, 1.9 is looking like a big win for Ruby.</p>

Most importantly is SQLite3 as the new database we’ll configure for by default when you run the rails generation command without any specification. This change comes as SQLite3 is simply an easier out of the box experience than MySQL. There’s no fussing with GRANTs and creates, the database is just there. This is especially so under OS X 10.5 Leopard, which ships with SQLite3 and the driver gems preinstalled as part of the development kit.

If you want to preconfigure your database for MySQL (or any of the other adapters), you simply do “rails -d mysql myapp” and everything is the same as before. But if you’re just playing with a new application or building a smallish internal tool, then I strongly recommend having a look at SQLite3. Thanks to the agnostic db/schema.rb, it’s as easy as changing your config/database.yml to switch from SQLite3 to MySQL (or another database) as soon as your load warrants it. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[OK. Nice to the tweaks flowing...]</cite> <br />

It has replaced parking lots and traffic lanes with chairs and umbrellas in Dumbo and the meatpacking district and installed a new, physically separated bike lane on Ninth Avenue; it is pushing the mayor's controversial congestion- pricing plan; and, in a symbolic act, it has given over three parking spots by the Bedford Avenue L stop to bike racks. Taken together, it's as if the department has awakened to the idea that streets belong to people, not their vehicles.

The results were so dramatic that they weren’t sure whether to believe them: the ten-day line-infection rate went from eleven per cent to zero. So they followed patients for fifteen more months. Only two line infections occurred during the entire period. They calculated that, in this one hospital, the checklist had prevented forty-three infections and eight deaths, and saved two million dollars in costs."

<a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2007/12/17/city-pedestrian-crossings-are-discriminatory-by-design/#comments">City Pedestrian Crossings Are Discriminatory by Design</a>: The team found that senior citizens begin to show signs of distress and engage in dangerous crossing behavior -- such as speeding up their walking pace, walking unsteadily, standing in the street before beginning to cross and crossing before the signal has changed -- at wider crossings to compensate for the fact that they walk at slower speeds. Coupled with the fact that 95 percent of vehicles observed during the study period did not yield to pedestrians, the study concludes that wider streets present unacceptable risks to elderly pedestrians. These risks have an overwhelming impact on the well-being and quality of life of senior citizens.  <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[What a mess...]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://gothamist.com/2007/12/19/bloomberg_says_1.php#comments">Bloomberg Says Let Them Eat Fruit</a>: Speaking at a press conference announcing the plan, Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas R. Frieden pointed out that “we are in the midst of an obesity epidemic. In some neighborhoods, rates of obesity and diabetes are 50 percent higher than the citywide average.” But the Neighborhood Retail Alliance opposes the plan, fearing a loss of business to the carts.  Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist for the bodegas, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/12/19/2007-12-19_veggie_carts_get_push_from_council.html">told the Daily News</a> the “real problem is the lack of demand. If the demand was high, the stores would be well-stocked.”<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[This comment, while rational on its face, fails utterly in the specifics. Salad and fruit are an important part of a healthy diet. But they're not particularly calorie dense. When your hungry and you don't have a lot of money, calorie density calls out to you... you look for carbs and sugars. Since we make chips and snack foods mostly from corn and corn divisions, they are inexpensive from a quantity standpoint, and high in sugars and carbs... exactly the sort of food that overweight and diabetic prone folks ought not to be eating. Additionally, vegetables and fruit need to be eaten fresh, and therefore purchased more often, so a busy person will buy some but less, since you can't store it as long as a packaged food. All in all, it is a vicious circle that is hard to break. I'm not sure that this is an answer, but it certainly can't hurt.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://scripteka.com/script/js-spec">js-spec</a>: Want to do BDD in Javascript? This aims to clone rspec (http://rspec.rubyforge.org) in javascript.

For now it&#39;s very basic, but stuff like the following works.

<pre>
describe(&quot;A newly created Tic-Tac-Toe&quot;, function() {
  with (this) {
    before(&quot;each&quot;, function() {
      this.game = new TicTacToe();
    });
	
    it(&quot;should have 9 empty cells&quot;, function() {
      game.cells.should( have(9, &quot;items&quot;) );
      game.cells.each(function(cell) {
        cell.should( be(undefined) );
      });
    });
	
    it(&quot;should have 0 players&quot;, function() {
      game.should( have(0, &quot;players&quot;) );
    });
  }
});

</pre>

Stay tuned for more :)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
Most of the time what we often call simple is really "optimized" for some particular thing. To use the same example as Paul Homer mentions in the piece quoted below, if you purchase a food processor to speed chopping, and you use it for one small chopping task, you'll most likely spend more time cleaning the parts than you saved with the speedy chopping, and now you have to store it, care for it, and add complexity to another aspect of your life. Not so simple eh? It may be optimized for the fact that you broke your wrist a week ago, and chopping is out but everything else is OK, or any other set of factors that might make what seems "less than the simplest thing" optimized as a solution. (BTW, cleaning it, storing it, and good knives explains why we don't own one, for us/now that's an optimization.)

Something that is simple when a problem is small is often not simple at all when the same problem is big. If I need to print one piece of paper and deliver it in a timely fashion there are so many solutions to the problem that "what is simplest" can be defined by other factors such as where I am, how much time I have to devote to this today, importance of the document itself... but if I have to print 50,000 items and deliver them in a timely fashion, or I'm the New York Times, the same solutions are not available. Other constraints narrow the number of solutions and complexity rises.

These are two aspects of the same concept... that we're generally not simplifying, as nothing is simple, but we are optimizing for our current set of issues. And the important difference is that optimizations must be tweaked and maintained to remain optimal because our lives are not static, and the problem space grows or shrinks and certainly changes. "Simple for me is not simple for you" is a problem every business deals with in many ways. As a developer I run across this in interface design, and keeping code "simple", and many other ways.

One of the things I hope to continue to get better at is "feeling the pain" sooner, being more aware of the shifts away from "maximally optimized" in order to ensure that more things remain as balanced as possible. It is an important skill to be able to retrospect with clarity.

My wife and I have been working hard on "simplifying" our lives, a multidimensional problem that encompasses who we were before we met and joined our lives, who we want to be together, our child, and so much more. By constantly looking at how we're doing, and paying attention to the feedback presented by how we feel about things, we progress toward what we describe as simpler lives, but is really, a more optimized life at a given moment. Good enough.

<a href="http://theprogrammersparadox.blogspot.com/2007/12/nature-of-simple.html">The Programmer's Paradox: The Nature of Simple</a>: Without a measure, you cannot be objective so you really don't know if you've simplified it or made it worse. In any multi-variable system of equations, you might use something like linear programming to find some 'optimal' points in the solution space, but you cannot apply a fixed simplification, at least not one that is mathematically rigorous. Finding some number of local minima is not the same as finding a single exact minimum value.</div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[...they've been few and far between this year. I really need to get out more. Here's my latest attempt.

I have a scheduled call at 10am. I have to drop off my son at brother's because my sister-in-law is kind of enough to watch Noah, what with day care being closed for the week (sigh). They live about 35 minutes away, and I can drop him at 8:15. Then I'm meeting some folks for a bike ride at 11 about 15 minutes away. No sweat right? A little preparation, and this should be easy.

Uhh, not so much.

Noah despite going to bed late, is up at 4:50am. And cranky, fidgety-tired to boot. OK, I've dealt with this before. Moving along, we get my wife out the door... I should be 15 minutes behind. I start to get the recycling together and then it starts to unravel.

First Noah wants cereal, and not just the bag I'm preparing for him (we have one ready, but he normally takes more...) but he wants the additional cereal in the already full bag. We work something out (he more or less gets his way) and I finish up with the recyling. Then he wants a bowl and some milk with his cereal, and I have one more task to do, so I figure what the heck, and set him up. (Can you feel the lateness piling up?)

Next, I get him into his coat, and start grabbing all the stuff. Noah meanwhile decides that one bear is not enough for today's excursion and that three would be better. I've got my coat on now, and proceed to grab (in no particular order) his lunchbox, backpack, blanket, bag of plastic recycling, extra bag of cereal, newspapers and magazine recycling, keys, and ultimately Noah. We make it down the stairs, I get the garage door open, drop off the recycling for the moment, niftily shift the keys to a position where I can open the car. Turn around, and... no Noah. Sigh.

I drop his stuff in the car, go back to find him in the hallway struggling with his bears. Get him out the door and into his car seat. Strap him in, he gets the bears situated. Leaving the door open, I put the recycling out by the curb, collect the newspapers walk back past Noah, who has chucked at least one bear onto the driveway, and drop off the papers. I get yelled at (did I say he was cranky?) for not arranging the bears correctly, and leave him to do it. I know this is going to be trouble, but I close the door now, so I know the bears will at least be in the car.

I get in car, start things up, and commence defrosting the windows. Shouldn't take long. Noah's already demanding "his" music so I plug in my iPod, and find whatever unnamed song he's demanding on top of his lungs ("Not that song Daddy, the clapping song." Huh? Whatever, "this one?, this one?, this one?..."). OK, the windows are clear enough, start to back out and hit some piece of (de)construction junk piled up on the side of the driveway ripping the left side of the front fender off the car. Who'd a thought it was that easy? I see dripping... uh oh. Hmmm... seems to be the windshield washer fluid. Did that break or is it just pulled out? Dunno. Doesn't really seem to click in... but my hand is freezing from the fluid dripping on it and I can't see any better and I'M LATE!!!

I bash the flap b's from the bumper into the slot a's on the car and get things pretty much squared away, totally cursing the guys who left the studs with the nails sticking out in that spot with just the right number and height of them stacked so that they were invisible from inside the car, the universe at large, etc. and head off to drop Noah. Several blocks later Noah informs me that his foot is cold. "Your foot is cold?" "I want my sock back Daddy". Noah often removes his shoes in the car but he's usually sane enough to leave his socks on so his feet don't freeze. Not today. Find a spot to pull over, find sock, and shoe, put them back, ask Noah to please not remove his shoes and socks in the car without permission, and proceed promptly to turn onto the interstate in the wrong direction. Sigh.

Worse, there's no close exit to turn around, so now I've added 15 minutes or so to my trip because I have to go around the long way to get to my brother's house. Have I mentioned I'M REALLY LATE!? Noah falls asleep because he's exhausted so no more disk jockeying for me. There's some, but not a critical amount of, traffic. I meet my brother in the driveway, we pause briefly for pleasantries, and then it's time to get Noah going. I grab all his stuff, and him (since he's mostly asleep), and bring him inside. I lay him on the couch and start answering questions that I thought my wife had discussed and answered earlier. Noah wants me to sit with him despite being excited about spending the day with his Aunt (he really loves her). I catch my first break, a show Noah enjoys is playing. He's happy to sit and watch (a treat for him). A few more questions and I'm out the door, running back toward home and my phone call.

I get home 45 minutes later than I expected, now wondering how I'm going to get it together to meet my friends. I start redressing, realize that half of what I need is downstairs, redress a bit since there could be a painter there any second, and as I'm making my way down, realize that the phone's going to ring any second. And so it does. 25 minutes later there's no way I'm making it to meet my friends.

When I first planned this ride it was with one person. Last night it blossomed to three other people, which was totally cool, except, now it wasn't a "sorry, I'm running late and let's figure out how to make this work", it was a I'd be hanging up the group thing, and no chance of rearranging. I was self-annoyed to say the least. I put on a nice voice and called my friend. The upside, I didn't screw up her ride since she still had folks with whom to ride... downside, it was going to be fun and I've missed a chance to hang with some great people and get some exercise.

That's what my excited preparation looked like from the night before... ah well. All I wanted for myself was a ride...

And just read about the ride you missed <a href="http://butterflybike.blogspot.com/2007/12/annoying-ride.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>  You didn't miss much, if it's any consolation.  Just not meant to be I guess.  Let's plan another ride soon, just us so you can be tardy (or me!).  I think if you had fought through all that junk today and then gotten to the trail and had the junky ride we did, you'd have been even more annoyed.  Then when we got home it started to rain.  Riding wasn't going to happen.  

I hope your day got better!!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/my-year-of-living-dangerously">My Year of Living Dangerously</a>: Being consistently broke this year has given me a great perspective though. I'm fascinated and disgusted at the same time by the people who use sites like Wesabe or Mint to tally, organize, count and recount their money over and over again. I mean, do you realize that more than half of the U.S. doesn't have any savings beyond a 401k, and the bottom third has no savings at all and heaps of debt? From reading the echo-chamber on the blogs you'd think everyone would find these sites useful. They're not, especially to the 100MM people in the U.S. that aren't in the middle or upper class. Seriously, where are the online financial services that will let me schedule out a bunch of bills, and pick and choose among those I can afford to pay this month based on an income that's less than the total debt payments? That's what I - and the other 1/3rd in the U.S. - would like to see, believe me. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I had serious conversation about a product like this, although the focus was savings not bill schedule displacement. However, the important difference I see is that it is hard for that bottom third to gain enough access to computers to make the service worthwhile, and of course, they can't pay for it directly, it would have to be ad based or collect bounties for steering people to other useful credit tools/services/etc. Not simple. I should add that I spent quite a few years being poor when I worked as a musician, and can feel his pain quiet acutely to this day.]</cite></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Other than a few bright spots (1999 and 2007) I've been in the same situation pretty consistently for the last ten years, and I know lots of other people in the same boat.

I disagree very strongly with the premise that most of those 100MM can't get access to computers. Many many of them have low end desktops. They may be a few years old, and the owners may not know much about running them, but they do have them.

Even Mike's and Shannon's (Lauren's Mom and Dad) old friends have access to the web, at least when they have homes.

I'm not arguing that the software would be a good idea. Personal experience says what most of the poor (anybody from middle-lower to lower-middle class) need is training in basic money management training. We help at the <a href="http://www.warmshelter.org/" rel="nofollow">local shelter</a> one day a month. Most of these people have low-paying jobs, and (the dry ones) spend almost all of their money on coffee, tobacco, fast food and lottery tickets.]]></wp:comment_content>

I accept what you say about access, and that folks often have it. Is it helpful? Can it be made more helpful?

It's all just a tool, so how you use it matters... but something that eases the way if only a little can make a difference. I'd like to continue to try.]]></wp:comment_content>

PCMs are materials that can absorb, store and release heat while the material changes from solid to liquid and back to solid. This is known as a phase change. Water changing from solid (ice) to liquid is an example of this phenomenon. During these phase changes large amounts of heat are absorbed or released." Rather amazing stuff, and it works in real life in my experience.

Another great bit of tech, which I wish was more widely adopted the <a href="http://www.boatechnology.com/">boa lacing system</a>. I had a pair of winter cycling shoes that were not cutting it. Simply put my foot was cold far to early an often, and worse, they did an awful job of insulating the bottom of my foot from the metal, cold conducting cleat just underneath it. Another less problematic annoyance was that getting in and out of them was painful. All these winter sports shoes have ankle cuffs that seal the boot, but in doing so have made it difficult to get your foot in and out. Fortunately I tend to do it only once a ride so I ignored it as a problem and accepted it as the way things had to be.

I was so annoyed the other day by the cold emanating from the cleat, that I stopped mid ride at my LBS and asked the winter hard core what the recommendation for footwear was these days. I didn't expect to be able to do anything since stocks of that sort of stuff is generally low by this time. But to my delight they had a pair of the recommended shoes in my size albeit <a href="http://www.lakecycling.com/ProductInfo.aspx?productid=CXZ302">the road version</a> (booo), and they were so much better than what I had that I switched right then and there. One of the things that made them better was the boa lacing system. Pull the knob and they release and the slack allows the boot to open wide. Get your foot in, and a couple of turns and the lacing system has gathered the slack and now allows you to fine tune tension. Amazing. I'm now looking for other footwear that uses this system I enjoy it so much.

The reason the road version isn't as good as the mountain version is simple. The mountain version is far more walkable. Anyway, I'll make that change down the road, for now, a serious improvement.

Now these shoes bring both these products together, but there are other bits and pieces of them spread around. Worth checking out.

One last tip. Cycling clothing is generally overpriced x4. It's a crazy industry. Many winter sports share the same requirements, so look around for stuff that works for runners and skiers etc. Chances are it'll work for you as well, and be far less expensive.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sporthill.com/">SportHill</a> makes a bunch of clothing aimed at active outdoor users. They're Zone3 stuff is aimed at cold weather (0 -40 degrees F) and since it is aimed at active wearers has enough lycra and stuff to be great. You can totally replace multiple layers with clothing like this and be more comfortable. I certainly find them more comfortable than the one bit of cycling specific cold weather tights I have. They're windproof to 35 mph and are a comfortable 4 way stretch fabric with a waist tie, zipper side pockets, and zippers down by the ankles. The XC Pant made of 3SP. Skiing, Skating, Biking, and not nearly as geeky as cycling clothing. They also make the more "jeans like" (a bit of a stretch thinks I) ATV II. A new favorite company and product.

A bunch of years ago I bought a jacket that looked like wool on the outside and had <a href="http://www.primaloft.com/">PrimaLoft</a> insulation. Hailed as a replacement for down, I simply thought the jacket looked nice on me and wasn't very heavy. Sadly at the time I could almost never wear it because it was too warm. I was a lot heavier then, almost never got cold and didn't expect this light jacket to be so warm. All these years later where getting cold seems to be a daily affair while I sit, I bought another jacket with PrimaLoft in it, only this time it's working for me. I have a really nice down jacket called the <a href="http://www.mountainhardwear.com/Product.aspx?top=1&amp;prod=27&amp;cat=38&amp;viewAll=False">Sub Zero</a> from Mountain Hardwear it's the third jacket of theirs that I own. This year I added the <a href="http://www.mountainhardwear.com/Product.aspx?top=1&amp;cat=36&amp;prod=181">Torque</a> since I knew my commute would be changing. Last year I did the train all winter (lots of standing on cold, windy, train platforms and walking to and from stations) this year in order to spend more time with my son at night I've been driving. Driving requires a lot less insulation, and I wanted something simpler than the layered (fleece jacket with shell over) to get in and out of. Since this jacket was on the clearance rack it joined the party. It has a lot of nice features for snow activities or commuting and is warm enough to not require a middle layer beneath. I should add that last year there were times when I wore the middle fleece layer, the down jacket, and the shell over it (to protect it and add even more warmth) with the upside being that once I was in the office I wasn't sitting around swaddled in layer upon layer, but still managed to not freeze waiting for trains at the station platform, which I honestly think is the coldest, windiest place on earth. (If you sit inside with the trains I had to take you were not, repeat *not* getting a seat, because there's some hard as nails commuters out there. It was either harden up, or stand for close to an hour and a half. I split the difference, and used tech to my benefit). Anyway, from my long removed from the product line Ethereal shell (at least 10 years if not more) to this jacket I can recommend Mountain Hardwear as a great line of hardworking outdoor gear. Two of the pieces use their waterproof, breathable Conduit membrane (which they claim uses "interconnecting molecular conduits to actively draw moisture vapor away from your body"). I'm sure I wouldn't know, but both pieces are comfortable.

Some last generic bits of whatever this has become... I've come to love so called "micro-fleece" tops. I can layer them over t-shirts or wear them as base layers. The brand hasn't mattered too much... some wear longer than others, but they often cost a lot more. I love stuff from <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/web/us/patagonia.go?assetid=2047">Patagonia</a>, although I can't afford it until a store clears it out... and I also love the companies focus on taking care of their people and the environment as best they can. Check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Let-People-Surfing-Education-Businessman/dp/1594200726">Yvon Chouinard's book</a>. There's also a <a href="http://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/itunes.stanford.edu.1351785299?i=1969551332">free talk on iTunes</a> from him that is well worth checking out.

Why all this? A friend asked...

<a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20071231/124515.shtml">Washington Post Flubs Story On RIAA -- RIAA Still Not Going After Personal Copies (Yet)</a>: Back at the beginning of December, we helped <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20071211/101325.shtml">debunk</a> a story making the rounds claiming that the RIAA was going after a guy named Jeffrey Howell for ripping his own CDs to his computer.  That story was misleading, at best.  While we know that the RIAA is constantly pushing to extend both the meaning and scope of copyright law, in this case the details were pretty clear that they were <i>not</i> going after Howell for just ripping his CDs, but for putting those ripped files into a <i>shared Kazaa folder</i>.  Now you can (and we do!) disagree that simply putting files into a shared folder are infringement, but that's different than just claiming that ripping the CDs is illegal or that he was being targeted just for ripping the CDs.  Unfortunately (and for reasons unclear to me), the Washington Post has revived the story, again <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/28/AR2007122800693.html">repeating that Howell is being targeted for ripping his own CDs</a>.  That's simply not true, and it's nice to see a true copyright expert like William Patry <a href="http://williampatry.blogspot.com/2007/12/establishment-press-takes-riaa-on.html">question the Washington Post</a> on this as well.<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[An important distinction.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[They often start with "Get some gigs, start building a following, do some recording (because it's super cheap now that digital is everywhere) give all that away, rinse, repeat, and sell merchandise.

That is not a business plan folks, and it simply solves the audience desire for free recordings.

First of all, getting gigs is not that simple, and are plenty expensive to a band (or band leader). There are many fewer places supporting live (especially original) music, and plenty of reasons why you need to be either willing to work for free or a loss or established. And trying to make a living selling merchandise for a band without a following is also not a winning solution.

So while a recording can be considered a promotional device the question is how to you support the cost of creating it? True the incremental cost is small, but how much does the first copy cost?

Also spoken about as if it were magic is the sell the rare, give away the ubiquitous. This is the start of the subscription model where the artist figures out ways of getting folks inside. Pre-release tracks, backstage passes, etc. It doesn't solve the promotional problem of finding places to play.

Here's something that a lot of folks don't think about. Not everyone is good enough to make there living as a musician. It's not a right that you can invoke because you desire it, and the greatest work ethic will not guarantee anything either. To be good enough as a song writer, player, etc. to support yourself in this scenario of playing your own music for adoring fans is in and of itself rare. Desire doesn't change that. Promotion doesn't change that.

Maybe that's all there is to it?]]></content:encoded>

More companies that produce food and clothes for cyclists need to be made aware of the impact of their products packaging, and the industry as a whole needs to remain aware and hopefully on the cutting edge of reducing its impact on the world. Riding is just one way.]]></wp:comment_content>

<a href="http://www.lukemelia.com/blog/archives/2008/01/06/what-i-do-a-meme-perpetuated/#comments">What I Do - a meme perpetuated</a>: Far be it form me to break the chain... so here goes.

<p><strong>My Day Job</strong></p>
I work as a software developer at Oxygen Media, which was recently bought by NBC/Universal. I'm still not sure how all that will shake out for me. 

Frankly I hate the term "day job" because it implies drudgery or sysiphisian tasks to me -- that the only reason I do what I do every day is because I need to pay bills. That's not something that I see as "life affirming". And truly, life is too short to spend so much of it doing stuff you don't like. I try not to. So while I don't commute to Chelsea because of any love for commuting to Chelsea (1.5 - 2.25 hours one way on average), it has been, for the last year or so, a chance to work, learn, and play with some very talented, creative, and energetic people, and it certainly remains my plan to continue to place myself in situations where those qualities are abundant and appreciated.

<p><strong>My &#8220;Contribution&#8221;</strong></p>
I'm not as organized about this as some. I've sent a pile of recordings and equipment to my former college. I've supported some folks with debilitating MS with other gear that they couldn't afford. I've sent money to various cancer fighting institutions, and done a bunch of fund raising recordings for folks who've ask. I've spent a little time building bikes for kids who otherwise would've gone without. I prefer my giving face to face as it were. It's harder to bear the pain, shame, embarrassment, and need, but it increases the chance of real good occurring (I should add that the pain and embarrassment etc. is *mine* for paying so little attention to the needs of others and society, and so much to myself. (And even this is all about me. Sigh.)) I've authored some software and formats that are used by a large segment of the public and those things were free for the enjoyment of all from their very inception... but in all these cases I get way more out of it than the folks at the other end. So who's contributing to whom? I dunno. But there it is.

<p><strong>My Night Job</strong></p>
I don't really have one. I always figured that if I was so amped about something that I wanted to do it in the precious non-work hours, that I should do it fulltime. I can't always make that happen, but I try. I still consult for some folks because they've maintained an ongoing relationship. I still play on recordings for some folks when they ask, or to cover for some particularly egregious personal situation. That's about as close as I come.

<p><strong>Other Stuff</strong></p>
I'm a member of a number of wonderful communities. There's a <a href="http://www.rocklandbike.org">bike club</a> that has got it's heart and wheels in the right place. I've been making music with the same folks for well over 20 years, and have been part of of an informal group of developers that have worked alongside each other for a almost as long. It has never been easier for people to share their stories and form communities on the internet. It's a great gift. But there's nothing like getting in a room with other folks, or going for a bike ride with a group, or spending a night in a recording studio with a few friends. People are the most powerful magic the world has to offer. 

<p><strong>My Family</strong></p>
I have a very tight knit family. It's not large, one older brother, one younger sister. My wife's family is small as well, she has one older sister. Fortunately, all our parents are with us and celebrating anniversaries well into the 40th decade. My wife Lisa and son Noah are the joys of my life. Noah is extremely sunny and bright and can't help but brighten the lives of others, mine especially, the proud father. Our busy professional lives means that Noah spends his weekdays at school/day care. They take good care of him and he's learned a lot. But I leave my heart in that place every day.

<p><strong>Who Next?</strong></p>
This was the hardest part. I hope the burden isn't too great...
<a href="http://butterflybike.blogspot.com/">Jenni</a> you're up. And how about <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/">Seth</a>?

<a href="http://davesbikeblog.blogspot.com/2008/01/watchdogging-blogging.html">Watchdogging Blogging</a>: I think the best way to bring change about, is not by any cyclists’ rights movement, but by individual riders, clubs and small groups of friends who ride together setting their own rules and codes of behavior. 

When I’m out riding, I expect sloppy and poor driving from some people. I see it all the time when I drive my car, so it is not going to change just because I am on a bike. I stay alert; I ride defensively, and try not to let it spoil my ride. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[First, I'd like to thank Dave for being thoughtful and writing about these issues. 

Cyclists, when driving, often act/drive very similarly to car only folks with the common exception of usually treating other cyclists with courtesy (although amazingly, not always!). Same high speed, low courtesy, me first, doing too much at once behind the wheel, stuff (to generalize) that I find so obviously dangerous when on my bike. If everyone who rides a bike would drive as if they were on their bike it would be a great start, and would "put money where their mouth is".]</cite> <br />

It's January and another Santa Project has come and gone here at People to People and we would like to thank those responsible for making it a great success.

At present, we've estimated approximately 3,000 children received gifts through Santa Project 2007. That represents about 1,100 families, all of them your neighbors right here in Rockland. There were 750 "Dear Santa" letters adopted and enough toys, checks, clothing and food came rolling in to help approximately 350 more families. I wish I could share all the hugs and blessings I received on your behalf. You lit up the faces of children young and old and gave hope to families who have, in one way or another, felt the tides of hopelessness in 2007.

<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/sethsmainblog/~3/220171895/how-much-for-di.html">How much for digital?</a>: It's important to charge something, because the act of paying fundamentally changes the dynamics of the relationship. The question is this: at the start, is your goal to maximize profit or to build a platform that scales? The fact is that the market is too small right now for the price to matter. What matters is whether you can build an audience that is in the habit of paying you, an audience that wants to hear from you, an audience that you can build a business on.

At fifty cents a rental, all desire for piracy goes out the window, replaced by convenience, ease of use and a clear conscience. More important, entire new services show up, habits are built and the studios end up with a direct relationship with consumers who want to hear from them. If they don't get greedy at the start. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I think Seth nailed this one.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Laurence Gonzales in Deep Survival writes about "Who Lives, Who Dies, and Why". There are some clear lessons in the study of physical survival in the wilderness.

We all operate in failure mode... all the time. All. The. Time. Most failures are small ones, a dropped bit of food, a spilled drink, extra traffic, a burned-out light, the glitches we dismiss as normal.

These system failures are the outgrowth of tightly coupled complex nature of our lives -- self-organizing complexity of astonishing proportion.

These small failures are normal and unfortunately, so are large failures. The small things are like the temblors in an earthquake zone, the quiet harbingers of the larger collapses that must eventually happen. Large accidents or failures, while rare, are normal too. Efforts to prevent them always fail.

Failure processes happen very fast and can't be turned off. Recovery from the initial disturbance is not possible; it will spread quickly and irretrievably for at least some time. These interactions were not designed into the system by anybody.

Doing bold things is not about engineering risk to zero. Failures happen, and if we restrict ourselves to where they can't... we're not going to do anything very interesting.

We'll all have good idea of how our system behaves with it's more frequent smaller failures. But we rarely understand how much energy is in the system... and how quickly things will go critical.

If we can't "engineer" it out, and we can't predict anything beyond that a failure will happen, what do we do? We trust, we risk, we embrace failure when it occurs and try to understand how it fits into the system, and like the walkers on the wire, we accept that at some point, everything may suddenly and irrevocably change. We also join and build teams of people, which are far more resilient than an individual. And from a business sense, can produce far more consistent results, with higher quality, and greater speed. And do bold things.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[More from Gonzales: Heraclitus said that every time you step into a river, it's a different river. Every time you walk a [mountain] it's a different mountain. It's a boundary condition, a phase transition zone. Because of that it can make a mockery of the most thoughtful plan. Experience is nothing more than an engine that drives adaptation, so it's always important to ask: Adaptation to what? When the environment changes (a given) you have to be aware that your experience might be inappropriate.

People are always part of the system. And people love forward motion. It's very hard to get them to disengage once a course has been set. Add to this that people "normalize" risk. If something feels less risky they'll take more chances; more risky and they'll take less. "We've been through a similar situation and emerged just fine." It's easiest to assume it was your skill and savvy, your adaptations that saw you through. That's why accident preventative engineering always fails. Add anti-lock brakes to a car and people push the limits of their driving skills. They feel safer, so they increase the risk until it matches their risk comfort zone. And of course, they get into more accidents since they no longer understand the level of energy in the system, and worse, feel protected from it.

Apply this to business. A project owner will increase risk until the level matches their risk comfort zone. If they fail to understand the amount of energy in the system, if this project represents a "different project" than the one they managed the last time, their adaptations (business experiences) no longer match... and the project is at risk from the outset. One disturbance will eventually lead to a failure cascade. As they say in mountaineering "A rope without fixed protection is a suicide pact." A project that is not self-aware, that does not introspect, that does not provide a voice to all the participants is a suicide pact.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/01/22.html">Five whys - Joel on Software</a>: After some internal discussion we all agreed that rather than imposing a statistically meaningless measurement and hoping that the mere measurement of something meaningless would cause it to get better, what we really needed was a process of continuous improvement. Instead of setting up a SLA for our customers, we set up a blog where we would document every outage in real time, provide complete post-mortems, ask the five whys, get to the root cause, and tell our customers what we're doing to prevent that problem in the future. In this case, the change is that our internal documentation will include detailed checklists for all operational procedures in the live environment. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Joel ran across the checklist article in the New Yorker and is putting it to use. Smart. So is understanding the value of service and where it makes sense to live on that continuum. Anyway, all this ties in nicely to the thoughts about system failures and people, with further proof that you cannot engineer out the occurrence of a collapse.]</cite>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So here's some starter steps to doing bold things.

At the top level...<ol>	<li>Dream Big</li>	<li>With high goals comes high risk</li>	<li>Things will go wrong</li></ol>

So, you've got a big dream... now what? Break that dream into manageable pieces. Vision drives activity so put that first manageable piece, that “focus” into writing. You want to reach a singleness of purpose, because that singleness drives simplicity into the project. Forget failures, forget past mistakes, only think about what you want now. Only work on prioritized activities. Once you've got your "singleness" together, prioritize your actions and use those as a guide. Otherwise the wandering and yak shaving will drive progress out of your dream.

Because you could well be risking a lot to make this big dream come true, don't take any uncalculated risks. Accepting risk will be part of doing bold things, but you can manage the risk you own by preparing. Two things dramatically reduce risk. Preparation and specificity of practice. Practice what you need to prepare for the task at hand. Practice to feel confident that you can handle many emergent situations. Be aware that your adaptations and experience maybe wrong. People tend to rehearse rather than practice. Rehearsing is repeating and refining. Practicing is developing new skills which are often the things you’re *not* good at! Don't waffle around, practice the specific things at which you are worst. Expert resources shorten learning, so by all means seek out experts to help you get in the groove sooner, or to explain adaptations that you never considered (differing experiences).

Things will go wrong. You'll balance and juggle, and dodge a few bullets as the saying goes, but sooner or later the big one is going to happen, and there's nothing you can do about it (before it happens).  When it does defer decision making until the last possible moment -- you’ll have the most knowledge. The critical step is to decide “when” is the last moment. Once you decided when "when" is, do not hesitate when it arrives. It's time for action! Rethinking “when” (rather than fine tuning it) could simply stall the entire affair until the clock runs out. Lastly, make decisions at the lowest possible level (respect people.) It's easy to convince yourself that no one has any insight but yourself or the couple of folks you interact with all the time. It's rarely true. People at every level can have the insight to provide the solution or resolution you need.

A corollary to things will go wrong is pain is temporary. Sometimes when things go wrong they hurt. A lot. It can certainly make you rethink what you're doing, and whether you ought to be doing it. It's almost always the wrong time to make that decision. Wait until the pain eases. You can only quit once. It might be the right thing to do, but it's a one trick pony.

Sales people will tell you that “No” means “Not yet”. It's a very wise piece of advice in many cases. Timing is critical for ideas and products to grab hold. Whether at the individual level or the broader market. You can always learn something from the folks who are saying no, about why, when, and what is working for them etc. that will probably improve your situation down the road.

Teams outperform individuals in many ways. Teams are far more resilient when things go wrong with an elastic strength that moves projects along when individuals run out of steam. Individual success is a team function in almost every case. To think otherwise is self centered, and usually incorrect.

Yesterday’s challenges are today’s norms. Once things thought impossible are now every day, ho hum occurrences. Expect that growth as part of your work.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Seems like simple advice. It's something I discussed with my wife just before the birth of Noah. The context was a discussion about whether to purchase a video camera. Our decision was based on my feeling that you can either concentrate on collecting excellent footage to be assembled into some masterpiece of cinema or enjoying the moment and not caring that it wasn't preserved for an eternity, or until the disk crashed, format changed, etc. Other's might be better at pulling this off, but I didn't want to split my attention. I wanted my focus to be on the delight and wonder of watching my child grow, not on whether something was exposed correctly, in focus, enough disk space of tape etc. etc.

It also works for all relationships and work.

Simple but powerful. Be of the moment. Be here now.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Disaster is not set up by inexperience but by experience.

When you *know* things and those things are untrue, they are far more dangerous than if you believe you don't know. Certainty kills. There's always hidden characteristics, newly input energy about which you are unaware. If you think you don't know, you remain agile and open. You improvise your way through ground you believe familiar, but on your toes, ready for the unexpected. Knowing breeds inattention. So while large scale collapse is virtually certain, your involvement in that collapse is not. The butterfly effect tells us that small inputs can create powerful effects. One moments attention could be all it takes to remove you from a catastrophe.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The folks that make Clif bars and other somewhat organic snack/energy foods have a <a href="http://www.2milechallenge.com/home.html">cool program</a> running where they ask that you ride your bike for errands within 2 miles of your house, since a lot of the miles we collectively put on our cars are for these short trips. Unfortuantely there are only two trips I make in a car that are within 2 miles of my house. Food shopping and gasoline. Sad.

Anyway, I was in a local organic produce store and saw some new flavors of their <a href="http://www.clifbar.com/food/products_mojo/1240">Mojo bars</a>. Surprised in this day and age of blogging and tweeting that a new flavor of a product could be released without seeing some mention of it. I wrote to the PR department asking why they don't send some stuff out to the bloggers (in this case me) and at least try to get some word of mouth out there. As of yesterday, there wasn't a single Google entry for their new stuff and no mention on their own website except buried in the press release section of a very search engine unfriendly site.

I'm curious to see if they write back.

<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/obie/~3/222436589/whats-this-crap.html">What's This Crap About a Ruby Backlash?</a>: Zed's rant triggered some patently false anti-Ruby memes that have now been bouncing around the programming blogsphere echo chamber for a few weeks. Disturbingly so. It's time to put a bullet to the head of the idea that Ruby is experiencing a widespread backlash, that it was just a fad, or that it is inferior to competing technologies such as Groovy. As far as I can tell, the originators of these ideas are people that betray agendas against the success of Ruby and/or Ruby on Rails. Specifically, I'm calling one of them out by name: <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[It's never dull 'round these parts.]</cite> <br />

Dr. Tanaka said he means doing things like regular interval training, repeatedly going all out, easing up, then going all out again. These workouts train your body to increase its oxygen consumption by allowing you to maintain an intense effort.

“One of the major determinants of endurance performance is oxygen consumption,” Dr. Tanaka said. “You have to make training as intense as you can.”

When you have to choose between hard and often, choose hard, said Steven Hawkins, an exercise physiologist at the University of Southern California.

“High performance is really determined more by intensity than volume,” he added. “Sometimes, when you’re older, something has to give. You can’t have both so you have to cut back on the volume. You need more rest days.” <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Plan for February: Ride (out or in) Sunday through Thursday. Intervals will be sprinkled into the schedule.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://www.postwritersgroup.com/archives/peir070930.htm">The Washington Post Writers Group</a>: "Vision Zero" -- no more deaths from highway accidents. The idea was born in Sweden, where it's had spectacular success in reducing traffic fatalities. Now zeroing out all traffic fatalities must become an explicit U.S. and worldwide goal. Otherwise we have no prospect of taming the appalling roadway death toll -- 42,000 lives lost yearly in the United States, close to 1.2 million worldwide.  [snip -ed]

How did the Swedes do it? Tough seat belt and helmet laws, to be sure. But they've also begun to remake their roadways. Red lights at intersections (which encourage drivers to accelerate dangerously to "beat the light") are being replaced with traffic circles. Four-foot high barriers of lightweight but tough Mylar are being installed down the center of roadways to prevent head-on collisions. On local streets, narrowed roadways and speed bumps, plus raised pedestrian crosswalks, limit speeds to a generally non-lethal 20 miles an hour.

<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[As said... imagine if that 42,000 death toll was from Jet crashes? Or a drug? Why is it an acceptable part of our lives since it comes from traffic? That's an awful lot of maximal system failures. We need to do better, and it starts with a Vision Zero plan for the country. Who's going to step up? So many roads in my neighborhood are barely safe because of the style of driving they reinforce. Walking is extremely dangerous during the day and nearly suicidal at night. Bike riding is horrendously dangerous at all times. Parking lot driving habits are awful... and the lots themselves are poorly designed. We must stop the madness.]</cite></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been riding regularly since the end of last year. After a terrible year (from a cycling viewpoint) I've recommitted to getting out. So I've managed to keep this up for over a month, and yesterday some friends who are back from their annual sojourn in Florida said they were riding so I took up a big section in the heart of the day for longer ride. (Thanks Lisa!)

The last time I did this ride I hadn't been on my bike for weeks and weeks, and not before that for weeks and weeks, etc., etc, and that's not a great way to have fun while riding with folks who are on their bikes all the time. I Panted and heaved and struggled and got dropped and dropped and dropped again, and generally had little fun other than proudly knowing that I had earned the price I was paying through neglect. Suffering on a bike has a long history. I was in good company, other than the relative speed at which all this was taking place.

So I've building back up a bit and it was time to go a bit longer and as it turned out faster. Amazingly the weather cooperated and it was relatively warm out (high 40'sF). That in and of itself was pleasant -- my birthday ride the other week was in the low 20's, the feel's like temps were 0F when we started out.

Anyway, we hit the first flat and we're cruisin' along and my partner drops off saying something about going back and riding with someone else, so I keep going. I continue on and when I actually look back I see no one. I'm awfully surprised. How could I have dropped this group of stronger riders and folks who have been riding every day in Florida? No idea. I still don't. I really lighten up now floating at 10MPH and shortly I here a "whoop" from behind, and a second later there's the group. One person suggested doping was the cause for my new found speed. I wondered whether I had just burnt all my matches unintentionally, and would be dragging and bonking on the backside of the ride.

But it turns out not to be the case, and there was plenty more groovin' along on this basically flat route. There were a couple of little hills which I struggled with as much because I wasn't prepared for them as anything else. For me tempo on even a short hill... and "knowing" the hill, where it gets steep, how to ride it (bigger gear here, spin here, out of the saddle here) is critical to maximizing what little I have.

However I felt some strength, and some spin, and just a bit more like someone who rides than I have in a year. I'm sure I held my partners back a bit on the ride home, but not so much that I felt like a drag. This month is "try to ride every day Sunday through Thursday" month for me. Yesterday was the start, and today should be no problem, though I have to get the trainer set up in addition to doing the spin.

I'll keep mentioning it over the course of the month to embarrass myself into keeping the commitment as much as possible.

The point of all this however, was to reming myself of the huge improvements that can be achieved simply by making riding routine. Even the once a week or better I've been doing has greatly restored some ability. I'm not sure why that should be such a revelation at this point, but it is. So now it's time to amp things up, and seriously prepare for the hills. I hope to ride shorter and more intensely this year as time is as short as ever, and there's less time for long lazy rides (as pleasant as those can be) so I have to make my time on the bike count, and that means intervals and hills. So be it. At least my knees aren't hurting for the first time in 2  or so years now.

Allez!]]></content:encoded>

And further, we claim and assert these rights by taking to the streets and riding our bicycles, all in an expression of our inalienable right to ride! <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Good stuff. Fight the good fight. Some of it is silly in that we already have these rights, but I believe what they are saying is that there seems to be the age old bias about "different" and how folks are treated. Just as with race, gender, color, etc. cyclists are seen as a group "separate" from normal folks, and therefore treated as "less than" by many. That really has to stop.]</cite>

<blockquote><p>Here is a how to guide on changing normal black cables or hose on your bike to pretty much any color you could want.  Not only is black boring, but the hard coating on the outside of the cables can rub through paint and even aluminum. I have seen a Hayes brake cable eat right through the stanchion on a Fox 40. Braided stainless brake lines look nice, but are expensive running over $50 a line and don’t match your derailleur cable.  By using the same heat shrink tubing electricians use you can protect your frame and match your cables to any color scheme for your bike.</p></blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So a <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2008/01/31/raising-the-clif-bar/">while back</a> I mentioned that I came across new flavors of <a href="http://www.clifbar.com/">Mojo bar</a>, one of my favorite treats, and couldn't believe that there was no information on the web, and no adverts that I had seen about the new flavors. C'mon! In this day and age?

So I'm now organizing The Great <a href="http://www.clifbar.com/">Mojo bar</a> Taste Test. They've sent me a box of each flavor including the new ones, and I'm in the midst of distributing the stuff to my friends who blog and ride and eat energy bars, with a request that they in turn write about their likes and dislikes, comments, notes, what-have-you. Ya know, blog stuff.

If you think you should be included in the Great <a href="http://www.clifbar.com/">Mojo bar</a> Taste Test feel free to write me daniel at circumtech dot com and we'll discuss it.

More as I think of it!]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2008/02/20/missing-urban-policy-in-the-presidential-campaign/#comments">Missing: Urban Policy in the Presidential Campaign</a>: It's not a new problem. For more than a generation, presidential aspirants have mostly resisted acknowledging the importance of the cities' well being. Blame the front-loading of the primary season with rural states, or electoral and legislative systems that give disproportionate weight to sparsely populated states. Whatever the reason, it is shortsighted. According to Bruce Katz, co-author of a Brookings Institution study promoting investment in metropolitan areas, the largest 100 cities and their surrounding communities are home to 65 percent of the nation's population and account for about 75 percent of the country's gross domestic product. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Here's a chance for a candidate to really separate themselves.]</cite> <br />

The instant hit in my household was the new dipped peanut butter and jelly flavor Mojo bar. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that peanut butter and jelly is one of the great flavor combinations of all time. In fact, one could argue that it should be elevated to an essential nutrient combination that absolutely no one should live without. I here so nominate it as such. Sadly, I live for long periods of time without enjoying the essence of life that is PB&amp;J because in sandwich form it packs an awful lot of stuff (calories, grams of this and that) into a fairly dense package. Not a good general choice for me. So once in a great while, as a treat, an indulgence, a gustatory extremism of the highest caliber, a lark even, I break out this extremely important flavor combination and have at it.

Now, however, courtesy of the new dipped Mojo bar, this flavor combo is far more available to me. I can budget for it far more simply. I can eat half a bar, and still get a huge thrill. It's nirvana in a small package.

Wow, you're thinking, the <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2008/02/18/the-great-mojo-bar-taste-test/">Great Mojo bar Taste Test</a> is over! Nah. I said it was a hit. Not the winner. Possibly not even my favorite, never mind the favorite of the other participants. So more <a href="http://www.clifbar.com">Mojo</a> coming soon...]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/feb/09/transport.world1">City's two-wheel transformation | UK news | The Guardian</a>: Planners hope the changes will encourage a "critical mass" of cyclists to use the routes, creating a safe and accessible environment as well as cutting congestion and pollution across London. "We are aiming to make cycling part of public transport and if we can get even 5% of people out of their cars, off the tubes and buses and on to bikes it will mean 1.7m cycle trips in London every day," said Mark Watts, transport adviser to the mayor. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[London is so far ahead of New York right now.

<a href="http://bikeportland.org/2008/02/25/a-year-before-the-tragedy-austin-miller-wrote-please-do-not-run-me-over/">A year before the tragedy, Austin Miller wrote “Please Do Not Run Me Over”</a>: A year before a tragic fate befell Austin Miller, the 15 year-old Beaverton student wrote an opinion article on bike safety for his school newspaper titled, “Please Do Not Run Me Over.”

Writing under the pseudonym “Charlie Elsewhere”, the article (full text below) was published in The Savant, the school newspaper at the Art and Communication Magnet Academy in Beaverton, where Miller was a sophomore.

Reading through it, I had mixed emotions. As a father, I found it chilling and immensely sad. As a bike advocate, I found it frustrating. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[It is to weep.]</cite>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for your thoughtful comment.

I *think* the point of the slogan is that often cyclists are treated as second (third?) class citizens and is a call for equality. I'm all for that. At the same time, while I think that cyclists should have rules specifically for them, though I believe that we're a long way from that in most places - except where separated bike lanes have been created.

Now my comment is simply that while cyclists are a minority and fighting for respect the large peleton of folks blowing through lights or stop signs, and generally ignoring the "share" portion of the program as much as any collection of motorists does not help the cause.

The utopia of utter respect and each group applying rules that make sense for them is just that, and therefore not part of my current thinking. That said, I routinely stop for stop signs and all other traffic signals on my bike as I would in my car. I roll through the same ones, and stop at the same ones. I take up the lane space I need to while respecting the rules, and folks around here (metro New York area) deal with it, even if not all of them like it.

Just yesterday someone barely passed three of us riding single file on the right hand side of the road, honking  and generally being rude. The pass was clearly not legal as the right hand mirror was within inches of two of us, despite us not having any more space to yield. It happens. Part and parcel these days... and get me started on the fixie/messenger style of riding in NYC.

But ya know, there's room for a bit of everything. And at the moment I accept the soup that it is, and condemn no one. Still, in the fight for respect, we have a greater than fair share of responsibility at the moment.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is a tough statement to make.  I live in Illinois, and the laws here were designed for cars- not bicycles.  I often find myself breaking the law in the interest of practicality and safety.  I find it irritating when cyclists complain about other cyclists breaking the law.  Motorists find this irritating as well, but if I actually came to a stop at every four way stop how many motorists would respect my order of arrival at the intersection?  I know from experience that they wouldn't, and they would use my hesitation as an opportunity to bust through the intersection ahead of me.  Further, how many motorists are interested in waiting behind a cyclist at a stop?

How about passing laws in Illinois?  If a motorist passes a cyclist they only have to provide three feet of space- and we are stoked that Illinois just passed that law.  If you are cyclists passing a motorist you are required to have eight feet of unobstructed pavement or a free lane to do so.  You are also required to pass on the left (despite the fact that we are clearly supposed to ride on the right).  That's just stupid- and it goes to show how little understanding the legislature has about the practicality of riding a bicycle.

Sure- cyclists need to be respectful of motorists, but that doesn't mean we need to follow laws that are ludicrous or unsafe when applied to cyclists as opposed to motorists.

No overweight legislator who drives an SUV and thinks bikes are toys is going to tell me how to ride a bike.

I can appreciate that some cyclists need to be more cautious, but give me a break- motorists break just as many rules as cyclists.  As far as I can tell, there isn't any problem with cyclists breaking the speed limit, but motorists get to do it with impunity in Chicago, and don't get me started on stop signs...]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2008/02/18/the-great-mojo-bar-taste-test/">Great Mojo bar Taste Test</a> continues...

In our <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2008/02/22/were-getting-our-mojo-on/">last episode</a> our intrepid hero had delivered Mojo bars to fellow cyclists of taste, breeding, and class. Or maybe not. Hard for me to say. Anyway, they're busy crunching their way through the bars and will be posting about them shortly. More were delivered Sunday, and the final batch are going out this week.

As for me, I've been enjoying the fruit/nut combos. There are two different bars, one of the new "dipped" flavors and and one of the original recipe. On comment I should make which is familiar to all who eat food in the outdoors during the winter. Be careful to warm the product as best you can (inside pocket, close to something warm etc.) because almost any food that doesn't freeze solid still turns into a rock. Some flavors are better than others... but still. You gots to be careful or, well... you may lose a tooth.

That said, I've always loved dried fruit and nuts, so these flavors should kinda be a natural for me. Unfortunately, I find them a bit sweet and since the part of the <a href="http://www.clifbar.com/">Clif Mojo</a> thing that I dig is that they are salty... at least saltier, this is not a good thing. I disclaim that I cook with very little salt, and eat almost no processed sugar and very few sugary sweets, candy bars, and the like. These bars are about as close as I come. No big philosophical thing here, simply what I need to do to stay healthy. YMMV. Anyway, I find dried fruit very sweet, and so these Mojo flavors are especially sweet tasting to me. I wish they were saltier. I do. But they're not. Sigh.

So while I like them, they fall into the "everything" else category of sweetish tasting power bars. Fine for what they are, but missing the essence of Mojoness for me.

<a href="http://intelligenttravel.typepad.com/it/2008/03/where-a-dollar.html">Where a Dollar Will Get You</a>: Ticket prices start at $1 (plus a 50-cent booking fee) and go up to market value, according to Dustin Clark, a Greyhound representative. Currently the market value is about $25. The earlier passengers book their tickets, the lower their fare will be. Passengers can book tickets up to six months in advance, and $1 tickets will remain available until the tickets sell out. Any extra seats can be filled by standby passengers on the day of travel, and walk-up tickets can be purchased for full price (market value). Ticket holders who purchase tickets online are guaranteed a seat, but BoltBus advises getting to the pickup point about 15 minutes before departure. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Nice idea. Where's the bike rack?]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.velonews.com/article/73139">Cyclists are remembered by friends and teammates.</a>: Gough and Peterson were on a training ride with about 8 other riders in Cupertino. A third cyclist hit by the patrol car, 20-year-old Christopher Knapp of Germany, was in stable condition Monday at Stanford University Medical Center, according to the San Francisco Chronicle Web site.

The California Highway Patrol is investigating why Santa Clara County Deputy James Council, 27, crossed the centerline on a right turn and hit the cyclists head on at about 10:30 a.m. Council, who had been with the department for 18 months, was put on administrative leave. He had started his 12 1/2-hour shift at 6 a.m.

Two witnesses said Council told them he had fallen asleep at the wheel, the Chronicle reported. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[RIP. Peace to the families and to everyone who was involved.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://ngadventure.typepad.com/blog/deep-survival-brain-vs-pe.html">Deep Survival: Brain Vs. Gadget</a>: You were rehearsing in your mind what you were going to do. You were creating what I call a mental model of your expected world and a behavioral script for what you were going to do in it. I would imagine that you unconsciously had all your moves planned before you ever got on the mountain, including the joy of reaching the summit. This is good. This is how dreams become reality. But these mental models and behavioral scripts can set traps for us and must always be viewed with caution. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Laurence Gonzales really gets this stuff.

<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Cyclelicious/~3/250379470/chicago-passes-bicycle-safety-ordinance.html">Chicago passes bicycle safety ordinance</a>: The City of Chicago passed the Bicycle Safety Ordinance this afternoon. The new law now establishes fines for turning left or right in front of a bicyclist, passing a bicyclist with less than three feet of space, and opening a vehicle door into the path of a bicyclist. Fines range from $150 to $500 and go up to $500 if the violation results in a bicycle crash.

It also establishes a fine for double-parking in a marked shared lane, and increases the fine for driving, standing or parking in a bicycle lane.

"We are committed to making Chicago the most bicycle friendly city in the country, and safety is a very critical part of the plan," Daley said after the measure passed. "More than 6,000 crashes between bicycles and motor vehicles were reported in Chicago between 2001 and 2005. Unfortunately, 30 bicyclists were killed. These new laws will help prevent injuries and save lives." <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Boy, do we need stuff like this 'round here.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2008/03/18/on-potato-omelets-and-winter-cycling/#more-3472">On Potato Omelets and Winter Cycling</a>: What these actions of mine and others lead me to conclude is that culture matters. I’m not shirking the fact of my own laziness; it’s a real observation about how the world works. If my friends and family members were riding off to work in the cold, I likely would to, without complaint. But alone, when few other people are, it’s easy to decline the invitation my bicycle offers me, or not even see it.

As we head into spring and the warmer months, this point will become moot. I’m sure I will once again start riding regularly. But maybe next winter, or the one after, I may make different choices. Cycling as transportation is increasingly popular in New York, and as this popularity grows, I suspect we will reach a tipping point, to use Malcom Gladwell’s famous phrase. I look forward to a future, perhaps not so long away, when even the fairest-weather riders like me venture out in even the worst of weather, doing so as easily as taking a bite of an easily-made potato omelet. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[So yesterday I joined the bike commuter ranks. In my case it is a "multi-mode" affair, because I'd spend way too much time commuting the 36 or so miles form home to work entirely by bike. I biked in my "street" clothes adding only a bike helmet and a bit of cover for my head (it's still a bit cold in the mornings for me). Nothing more seemed necessary, even though I do not have a "commuter" bike per se.

And the cultural stuff starts at home. My wife is trying very hard to be supportive, but would really rather not think about my riding in the City. Of course, there's no way to make it clear that riding the route I do is actually safer feeling than a lot of the riding I do in the suburbs because I'm not mixed with car traffic as much. The west side greenway provides a good chunk of the trip.

Naturally, today rain is expected this afternoon, and while it wouldn't stop me from a biking in the rain standpoint, the bike does have to survive the rest of the trip on top of the car in the rain. Not so much goodly as they say.

Which brings me to my point. The multi-mode, or park and ride, or plane, train, and automobile, or whatever combo of your choice infrastructure is very, poor, both public and private. It needs some attention if people are serious about changing how they commute. It's easy to say I will do something, and far more difficult to just do it when the facilities aren't there to enable it. I'd love to lengthen the bike portion of commute, but I need to find parking in NJ that makes sense. And more parking in NY that makes sense. And if the trains allowed bikes (or there was secure, out of the weather bike parking) I would have more choices.

One can argue about where I live, choices, etc. all one wants, but I live where I live and do what I do, and just trying to make the best decisions I can for a healthier life, commute, world etc.]</cite>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So the<a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2008/02/18/the-great-mojo-bar-taste-test/"> Great Mojo Bar Taste Test</a> has been <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2008/02/22/were-getting-our-mojo-on/">progressing</a>, bars are being <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2008/03/03/mojo-fruit-nut-dipped-and-crunch/">consumed</a> and now Gerry, who rode over 22,000 miles last year (um, no, that's not a typo. He's a bit of whack job...) weighs in with the following notes. I've taken a liberty here or there which Gerry may deign to correct. Or not. He's got a lot of riding to do after all...

He paused in his pedaling just long enough to jot down these notes:

All were good. My favorites were the Fruit Nut Crunch, Peanut Butter and Jelly (dipped) and the Chocolate Peanut. (dipped)
 
<ul>
<li>Mixed Nuts: Very nutty taste. Sweet. Good texture and flavor.</li>
<li>Fruit Nut Crunch: Fruity and nutty taste. Sweet, good texture.</li>
<li>Mountain Mix: Very good.</li>
<li>Chocolate Peanut: Excellent.</li>
<li>Honey Roasted Peanut: A little sweet for me. Good but not my favorite.</li>
<li>Peanut Butter Pretzel: Good but again not my favorite, Not much taste. A little chewy.</li>
<li>Peanut Butter and Jelly: Really good!</li>
</ul>

So there you have it. Gerry liked them all, but clearly went for the Peanut Butter and Jelly. He's really just a big kid at heart. There was an article in the <a href="http://lohud.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080109/RSS1803/801090362/1019/NEWS03">local Gannet paper</a> about his riding (and another club member), but they suck and have a "pay for" archive and they kill the URL on top of that. Sad.

Time to go prompt some of the other taste testers... including myself.

		<title>Rite of Spring :: Ride in Spring</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So rather inevitably there's a first ride after Spring has sprung. It can go unmarked in the annals of bike riding when you ride year 'round, but I try not to let that happen. I didn't always ride all year, and warmer spring weather (certainly warmer than today's start at 30 degrees) marked the start of the season and all the fun to come.

Once riding all year became more common for me it became easier to forget to the mark the occasion, since often it's just another cold day in a string of cold days. But today it was sunny and eventually warmish and the occasion was marked by the inaugural ride on a new bike frame.

I had a couple of cool winter projects this year. I have a "winter" bike. It can wear wear fairly large tires (up to about 40c I believe) and it's made of aluminum so it's able to deal with the salt and junk fairly nicely. It also has middle of the road parts, so the wear of riding through all that salt and sand and goo and yuck is taking place on less expensive parts, wheels, chain etc. I do what I can to keep it clean, but with no indoor facility for cleaning it, it remains a mess for the winter, and then it gets a good cleaning after the last ride of the winter. It may occasionally join the fray when I ride in pouringly wet weather.

As I settled into the winter regime, a friend noted some blow-out frame prices. It's a sweet little ChroMoly thing, and I built it up over the course of the winter as a single speed/fixie. It's the least expensive bike I own by far. Some parts were from EBay, some were the closet. The wheels were the most expensive component since I wanted single speed hub that matched the 130 spacing of the frame. Despite the parts sounding like they come from all over the biking universe, the end result looks nice and rides great... my first real bike also had only one gear (but it did have a sparkly purple banana seat and a low sissy bar).

The other project was trading in my road frame and moving almost all the parts over to the new frame. Shifters, drive train, brakes, bars, wheels, everything except for the stem, seat post, and saddle were moved over. The new frame is smooth, and efficient. Light as well, but that wasn't the real point. I've done enough riding to have some sense of where my old bike were letting me down, and yesterday, on the new bike's inaugural ride, my riding partner noticed the efficiency as we climbed a few miles of grade - that I hadn't geared down at all, kept the pace up, etc. Now part of me thinks its a crock, and that my screw the cadence riding style this year has more to do with it, but whatever. I enjoyed the ride of it, and this year that's what matters.

Other years faux training took over various aspects of my biking life. The reach to be faster, climb better, what-have-you drove me to bad training. Soft days not soft enough, hard days not hard enough, not enough rest, not enough base miles, incorrect nutrition - the whole gamut. Last year, my cycling fell apart altogether as life, business, and seemingly everything else came first, and I lacked the will to get up early or stay out late to do the riding. It was always dark, cold, and rainy, and never warm, sunny, and bright. I'd ride once in a while when things worked out, and then be annoyed at my lack of fitness, which naturally grew worse over the course of the year with the breaking point being an almost flat ride that I've done many times where I couldn't keep up with a slow group on a slight rise. That was it, as it were, the weather was getting cooler, I was still crazy busy, and I had just had enough.

A couple of months go by and the fall weather has passed and winter has set in. I break out the rollers deciding that it was time to break the downward fitness spiral. Did that for a while, bored to tears, and decided that I needed to find the "ride outside" thing that I love. I sorted through the winter clothes, found the right stuff, and started out just doing simple laps around a nearby lake, slowly reminding my body what riding was all about. Soon enough the miles had piled up, and I was beginning to feel a little more like a cyclist. Shortly thereafter was a group ride, on that same flat course that had beaten me down at the end of the summer. With some trepidation we rolled along, I was talking with a friend, and realized that we were off the front. She dropped back to talk to some one else, so I figured I'd just keep turning the cranks and they'd catch up soon enough. Pretty soon I realized that I had remained alone, and all but stopped moving. A few minutes later the group caught up, someone jokingly accused me of doping, and we rolled on. But it felt really good to be that comfortable.

Part of what I found this winter was the simple joy of cycling. The year "off" had broken the cycle of improvement, got me out of a "training" mentality and returned me to the fun of riding. Nothing's been more fun than doing part of my commute by bike. Wearing street clothes, platform pedals, etc. Just throwing a leg over and going. One gear. Just like was I was a kid. And now, when I do dress up and go out for twenty or more miles on the high tech, 20 gear, incredible lightness of being device, it feels right, and fun, and happy.

The last question I was asked recently was what happened to the mountain bike I built last year? Sold. My vision for that bike never worked out because I wound up being so busy. The trails aren't close and the roads start right outside my door. I decided that there was no point in storing it in the garage just for the sake of it, I didn't see anything changing anytime soon.

<a href="http://www.truerwords.net/6159">Ride #11: This Year It's All About the Pain</a>:
It's going to hurt, but I'm serious about really getting into shape this year.<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[It's funny how you posted this today when I <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2008/03/25/rite-of-spring-ride-in-spring/">also posted</a> although it was more about cycling related stuff than my plans for cycling. So as an update... I'm already riding stronger than I was through most of last year. And I expect that this may well be best year on the bike ever, despite my schedule. I was reminded last year not to set goals because my life finds a way to mock them mercilessly. I also mentioned that my lack of fitness and previous desire to improve became seriously debilitating. I've thrown all that away. It may be back one day, but for now, the riding is about fun. The cadence I choose is what feels comfortable. Where and when I ride will be about fun. I will work on technique when I choose so that too will be fun. And while I have <a href="http://spoken.phrasewise.com/articles/2006/08/24/why-goals-are-bad-why-you-dont-need-them-yet-how-to-get-better-in-the-meantime">issues with goal setting</a> (and Seth disagrees) last year only proved me right for myself anyway. I had goals, I didn't come close to meeting them because of major course changes, and they demotivated me in a serious way. I'm back to my old ways, making little course corrections, working on the stuff I'm bad at, and inspecting the result fairly often. Then I'll look back at what I accomplished with, well, a sense of accomplishment. Or I could continue to set a goal of finally meeting Seth, and going for ride, and failing to accomplish that as well. Heh. We'll see...]</cite> <br />

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think the big difference, for me, is that a goal is more like a milestone or a waypoint than a target. If I have a goal of 5000 miles, I don't stop when I reach it. If I have a goal of shrinking down to 235 pounds, I'm not going to stop riding and start eating ice cream for breakfast. It's just something that helps motivate me.

The riding is an end unto itself, because I love riding, but it's not the ONLY "end." I try to accomplish other things with my cycling time as well. The goals are just those things I'm trying to accomplish (lose weight, better health, raise money for cancer research, make friends, etc., etc., etc.)]]></wp:comment_content>

If, like me, you’re not smart or lucky enough to be able to do that, then all things considered, just earn more money, or spend less, and donate the difference.

Now’s the time when I unveil my project. My kick-ass killer app. The awesome user-generated content, ad-supported, Facebook-enabled, mobile-aware, Ajax-powered thingy. The thing that’ll cure AIDS or give sight back to the blind or whatever, all stored remotely on Amazon S3.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today a lot of people are aware of race issues because it's the 40th anniversary of the <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-04-04-voa7.cfm">assasination</a> of Martin Luther King, Jr. But one of the things that I don't think is being remembered as much(I was 4 at the time so have no memory of the event) is that one of the things he preached was love.

I've often used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethic_of_reciprocity">the golden rule</a> as a means of gauging my own behavior. Sure, treat others as you wish to be treated goes a long, long way. And there's no doubt, it's a personal work in progress. Still, if more people practiced the ethics of reciprocity routinely the world would be a nicer place. But on this day, when people are already discussing the measure of the King Dream, I'm asking that you love others as you wish to be loved.

It's harder, it requires more thought and greater commitment. You have to reach deeper and do more, you have to not just say, "hmmm how would I want to be treated" but what would I truly wish for myself and how can I extend that to everyone else.

And if we extend that to more of what we do, our interactions with others, a ever deepening desire to seek that level of love for all people, the world will in fact be better place, and where without further effort, people will be judged by the content of their character.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We live when we have something to live for.

Time and again, when you hear from a survivor, what you hear is "I thought of my son, daughter, wife, husband, parents..." We would think that survival would be a very selfish process, but it’s not. It’s much more about how embedded in a family or a community we are. Seemingly, we cannot save ourselves. Survival, even salvation, lies in our love for our family and community. Survivors literally use the power of love to survive. People who care about others have a better chance of surviving. At the moment of truth, if we are thinking only about ourselves, we are at a disadvantage.

How do we get ourselves into trouble? Simply wanting to do something can often overwhelm all other considerations. We know we shouldn't, but we want to. So we tell ourselves a story. Our story is built on truth. We turn experience into stories. They feel real and truthful to us. When the story reflects the world as it really is, we do well. When they don’t, we find ourselves in trouble. Want something badly enough and the story will only have the thinnest veneer of truth. It's a false story. And it leads to the commonly used phrase "What were they thinking?"

To use a recent example what was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/10/nyregion/10cnd-spitzer.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">disgraced former Govenor Eliot Spitzer</a> thinking? What story did he tell himself that made these actions OK?

And how many times did I hear someone say "What was he thinking?" in regard to Spitzer's actions? Too many to count. 

People swim in shark infested waters and get hurt..."What were they thinking?"
People climb mountains when storms are approaching... "What were they thinking?"
People get drunk, attempt to drive home and kill themselves and others... "What were they thinking?"

You'd never let anyone hurt you as badly as you hurt yourself.

Logic and reason can inform us but emotion makes us decide and act. And wanting is an emotional thing. Without the aid of the stories we create and the emotions they generate, we are all but paralyzed. Stories hurt us when they reflect only our desires. Stories help us by making other's experiences real and prevent us from having to experience every situation for ourselves. They warn us of things so we don't have to survive them ourselves. But for the latter to occur you need to be embedded in a family or a community, to trust other's experience. And as we know, people who do trust, who feel that connection, who don't only think of themselves survive even the the most dangerous, stress filled, gasping for breath, I-almost-lost-my-life moments. Such is the power of love.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://www.cabel.name/2008/04/coda-confidential.html">Coda Confidential</a>: We had just recently finished Coda, and with one hour to fill and a lot of Coda-related things still swirling around my mind, I pretty much just started talking. What followed was a whole lot of hyper-warp thoughts about all things Panic. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[So what caught my ear was the story of the first product they did which was an early version tracker which got shelved because they realized they'd either have to have access to "version tracker" or the like, or maintain their own database of latest versions.

This was kind of how <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/rsd">RSD</a> got started. I had a docs page which discussed the settings Archipelago (the blog editing software I had authored) needed for several of the major blogging platforms. As I was updating it for the millionth time with yet another engine I realized that I could write a document that Archipelago could use for setup, and the customer service emails (which is what caused me to update the page) would probably go away to a great degree. All I'd have to do is keep, say an XML file on my server up to date, and having done it once all Archipelago users could benefit.

Happy with the thought, I was dissatisfied with how this wouldn't reduce the problem to near zero because while I had all the major cases covered, it would always be my problem to keep "database" up to date. I looked for an existing format so that I wouldn't have to sell anyone on a format and found really dense hard to understand formats that were very general and didn't seem to cleanly fit the use case. I floated a couple of versions past the indie developers I know, found some support initial support from two vendors I cared greatly about, and the rest as they say is history.

It was a nothing to lose story in that if I had received a big yawn, I could have hosted the file for my users, and they at least would have had a better experience most of the time. But this result was far better since everyone has benefited, and we all continue to benefit from the support of the blog engine folks.

Anyway, years later it comes as little surprise that a lot of software small and large have similar birthing stories...]</cite> <br />

Backed by his Democratic conference, the speaker killed congestion pricing in the most cowardly way: without even holding a vote. Mr. Silver said so many members of his own conference were against the plan that it would never pass. How many? Who knows? The speaker hid behind closed doors to keep the public from watching his cronies do the deed. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Shameful!]</cite></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.smirkingchimp.com/thread/13696">Generation Squeeb: Barack Obama’s Reverend Wright controversy, and America’s squid-heart</a>: We can't focus for more than ten seconds on anything at all and we're constantly exercised about stupid media-generated non-scandals, guilt-by-association raps, accidental dumb utterances of various campaign aides and other nonsense — while at the same time we have no energy at all left to wonder about the mass burgling of the national budget for phony military contracts, the war, the billion dollars or so in campaign contributions to be spent this year that will be buying a small mountain of favors for the next four years. And we... shit, I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I'm just tired of this tone that's always out there when these scandals break, like we can't fucking stand the existence of this Wright fellow for even a minute longer, not a minute longer! — when we all know that come Monday, or Tuesday at the latest, Jeremiah Wright will be forgotten and we'll be jumping en masse in a panic away from the next media-offered shadow to fall across our bow. What a bunch of turds we all are, seriously. God help us if we ever had to deal with a real problem. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Too much truth here.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://blogs.smugmug.com/don/2008/04/08/thoughts-on-google-appengine/#comments">Thoughts on Google App Engine</a>: I’m more than a little concerned, though, by how much vendor lock-in there is with App Engine.  At first glance, it doesn’t look like the apps will be portable at all.  If I want to switch providers, or add in other providers so I’m not relying solely on Google, I’m outta luck.  

I’m hopeful other languages get supported, too.  I think Python is great - don’t get me wrong - but we have a lot more experience with other languages, so there’ll be a learning curve.

Finally, I’m dying to find out what pricing for an application of our scale will look like.  I can see some immediate, obvious things I’d like to try to do on App Engine, but the beta limits aren’t gonna cut it for us.  :(

[snip -ed]

My favorite bit?  In theory, Google has solved the data scaling problem.  I don’t mean raw binary (blob) storage, which S3, SmugFS, MogileFS, and plenty of other things have solved, but the “database” scaling problem.  Every popular web app runs into this problem, and it’s typically solved with a combination of memcached, federation, and replication.  But it’s messy.  In theory, Google has automated that piece for us.  I can’t wait to play with it and see if that’s true.

I also can’t wait to see who else is going to wade into this fray.  Sun?  Microsoft?  Yahoo?  IBM?   <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[More info from the field...]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been riding outdoors at least once a week since roughly December 2nd... usually on Sunday. Sometimes more, but not usually. Sometimes on the trainer, sometimes on the rollers in addition, but mostly it's been once a week on Sunday, and I can't think of a break in the streak.

Until now.

Passover is going to eat the next two Sundays. It's that simple. So while I'm going to try and get out in the middle of the next couple of weeks, odds are bad. So despite the slowly improving weather... (I'm down to three layers from five for these early morning rides) The next couple weeks could well be a bust. So it goes.

Today I rode with some folks I haven't seen in ages... they didn't ride through the winter. They were in typical Spring form, and to my delight, the ride felt slow and relatively easy. It was about half as long as the ride I've been doing, and every little rise seemed to stop one person dead in their tracks.

Normally, I wouldn't even notice... I'm rarely amongst the fastest folks... especially these last two years with all the knee pain (first left, and then right, one year each). Last year was a complete disaster, as somehow I almost never made it out to ride. I got slower and heavier all season, to the point where I couldn't keep up with folks I could blow away a year earlier. But this year, so far, I've been feeling good, and the consistent riding has helped. I still have a lot of weight to lose... but that'll come along (it's already started, but I have a lonnnnng way to go to get back to where I was.)

Today I wore a heart rate monitor for the first time. I got inconsistent readings, which serves me right as I spent no time testing before the ride. Other aspects of the new computer will unveiled soon. And I'll make sure I get the heart rate thing going over the next couple of weeks. Should be fun.

As an aside... I been riding the "weapon of choice" road bike for the last three weeks. Simply amazing. It's not in full regalia yet, I've been riding with the midweight wheels mostly because I'm heavy, and figured if I taco a wheel, it might as well be the less expensive ones, plus they're all crudded up from the winter, so until the roads are a bit cleaner, and I'm lighter... plus I never bought a new high end gruppo as planned, because, well, I wasn't feelin' it. This one will do for this season at least, we'll see what happens down the road. Even so, the bike is light, stiff, and comfortable. Truly amazing stuff.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://www.attentiondeficitdavid.com/2008/04/trouble-in-capi.html">Trouble in Capital City</a>: I suppose the lack of public discourse is because saying you're opposed to a major public-works housing project being located directly adjacent to the retail hub of the village makes one sound like a bigot—it sounds like you're saying you're not in favor of the people who live there.

Personally, I'm not in favor of the criminals that live there, just as I'm not in favor of criminals that live anywhere else. But really I'm not in favor of is a social-political development that fosters the continued dependance on the broken unemployment and social assistance programs in our country. I'm not in favor of any development that makes people of any income class live in small, squalid housing with little to no job training and no connection to the community.

I'm not in favor of treating people like lesser citizens because they make less money on average than most. I'm not in favor of ugly subsidized public housing that ends up fostering crime.

Maybe instead of talking about parking meters and who is going to run the marina and to what end, we should talk about how to develop sustainable housing in Nyack for ALL income classes, without making any look or feel like they are second class citizens, and without creating further blight in Nyack. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Right on David, right effin on.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my never ending quest for more fun with bikes and more time (and fun) with Noah, I finally got a ride in with him in the trailer.

Scene 1: Enter the trailer</br>
Really, I guess this should start with "enter Noah" but I've only got a few seconds here before you move on. So I EBay a bunch of stuff I'm not using and purchase a trailer... about a year and half too early it turns out. Ever the eager beaver am I, and in this case, hugely misjudge where Noah's at as far as this was concerned. So I stored a large box with said trailer over the winter.

Scene 2: Try, try again.
Assembled last spring, Noah stepped in, pronounced it worthy of further study and stepped out. Getting him to wear a helmet for longer than three seconds was out of the question. It was an affront to his dignity that I even tried.

No helmet no trailer, soooo no trailer. I, btw, don't think it's absolutely necessary for him to wear it in the trailer, but I'm not going to try and explain why "no" in the trailer and "yes" on the trike, or why when we ride on the trail it's ok, but not when ride on the road. So there.

Winter sets in and still no trailer ride with Noah. We continued to try but he was never interested. Then it got too cold as far as my wife was concerned, so I folded it up and once again, stored it for the winter. The plan became the just-work-the-trailer-into-conversation-about-going-to-the-park-when-the-weather-warms-up type stuff. Parentally sneaky, but isn't that what parenthood is all about? I think so. (Plus I just received notice that I'm in the running for longest dashed sentence. Rocks.) 

Scene 3: Behold the trailer!
In hopeful preparation, a couple weeks ago I rehydrated the trailer, inflated the tires and trailed it behind my bike round and round my short driveway for a mile (no, really, I measured) to make sure everything was ok. Nothing loose, no strange tipping, nor lack of soundness. Cool.

Today, as we prepare for the last couple of days of Passover (and the sad end to my vacation) Lisa needed some time with Noah out from underfoot, and the weather was calling. Taking one from the Better Daddy(tm) playbook, I whip out the ever so casual, maybe I should try and take Noah for a ride in the trailer? (Thus collecting good husband points, good daddy points, and bike time at once. A triple play!) And so we went. He's been excited lately because the weather warmed up and we've been making excursions to various parks (slides, swings, pirate ships, bikes, trikes, outdoors!) and so with his helmet (just like daddy) on his head, his bear in his hand, he buckled up and off we went. First just around the corner to make sure everything was cool from his perspective and then down the block and back and then around the neighboring streets. Only once did he complain about the wind (he's not a fan), and it was not generated by us, it was a sudden gust.

He did get a little freaked by a passing car—a nice, polite toot, and plenty of clearance on the pass, but stupidly I didn't warn Noah. He very quietly said "Daddy" and I looked back at him and something had taken the wind out of his sails. I pulled over and he added, "Something's behind us, Daddy". I made sure he was OK, explained it was just a car, and that he had a window where he could see out the back if he wished, and we moved on. It took a few minutes, but he was fine. Hopefully we both learned something.

But mostly he was singing, and shouting out directions ("Go this way Daddy!") and singing some more and enjoying the experience. And since he never seems to want to go home or inside once he starts,  suspect there'll be some nice long rides in our future. Wheee!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A quick ride with Gerry this morning. First I had to drop off Noah, then run down to Piermont for our start. Too much stress. Naturally, it was 35 degrees (F) outside as I was getting dressed, but it was warming quickly. Gerry had already been riding already (naturally) so after a couple of minutes of my fumbling around with clothes, off we went. First annoyance, the heart rate monitor wasn't being read. It connected shortly into the ride though.

This was the first ride on the "Weapon of Choice" with the light wheels installed. I'm not really any lighter, as I recover from the enforced carbs of Passover, but the winter wheels need some attention, and I don't want to keep riding on them until they get it. Naturally, the beater wheels have an old, not really working cassette on them, so they were not an option. I kept a light thought and prayed that I would not drop into a water system cover hole or something and taco a wheel.

Stats for this sneak a ride before work thing were 15.67 miles in 1:03:39.44, Avg pace 4:03/mi, Avg speed 14.8mph, Max speed 23.8. Avg heart 130bpm, Max heart 158 with just under 500ft of climbing (essentially flat). Not bad numbers for me in spring—better overall for this time period than over the last two years.<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/daniel-gerry-loop.png" alt="daniel_gerry_loop.png" border="0" width="383" height="291" />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So a while back, when I started the <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2008/02/18/the-great-mojo-bar-taste-test/">Great Clif Mojo bar Taste Test</a> and we've had a very cold spring. What that means is that the results are taking quite some time to accumulate. Sure the folks are riding and doing, but not the sort of long rides where somehow tastes change in odd ways, or where they need to pack energy along in the first place. (Little known secret, unless you're a skinny sort, working out all the time etc. you don't need extra calories (generally) for a two hour bike ride. I tell you three times.)

However some more results were written up a while back, and I never got around to posting. SO without further ado I present the always lovely, impossibly snarky, funny, and joyous Jenni on her <a href="http://butterflybike.blogspot.com/2008/03/mojo-bars-are-awesome.html">Mojo bar experience</a>.

The first thing that I'd add before I move along to the next bit of commentary, is that Jenni didn't even know these existed... which doesn't say much for Clif marketing. Sure this seems a bit like biting the hand that fed us (we did get the bars from clearly happening and with it Dean Mayer of Clif Bar Inc. afterall) but one so generous and kind will surely understand that I'm merely trying to point out that they are not achieving nearly the market penetration they should out here in the East, at least with Mojo bars.)

Next up was a partial report from David. Besides being the President of the <a href="http://www.rocklandbike.org/">Rockland Bike Club</a>, he's also an incredibly talented and created soul who authors columns, reviews, and books on photography, software, and stuff. He travels a lot, seems to find more than his fair share of food poisoning, and has done stuff like biked across Alaska. So without further ado, <a href="http://www.attentiondeficitdavid.com/2008/03/the-sort-of-gre.html">his rejoinder and first comments.</a>

More comments to come soon... I'm sure. Right? Hello? Seth? David? What's that? I haven't finished yet either? Yeah, yeah. It's coming. Soon. Really. No, seriously.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/2962">The Gospel of Consumption | Orion magazine</a>: This was the stuff of a human ecology in which thousands of small, almost invisible, interactions between family members, friends, and neighbors create an intricate structure that supports social life in much the same way as topsoil supports our biological existence. When we allow either one to become impoverished, whether out of greed or intemperance, we put our long-term survival at risk. 

[...continues]

Rather than realizing the enriched social life that Kellogg’s vision offered us, we have impoverished our human communities with a form of materialism that leaves us in relative isolation from family, friends, and neighbors. We simply don’t have time for them. Unlike our great-grandparents who passed the time, we spend it. An outside observer might conclude that we are in the grip of some strange curse, like a modern-day King Midas whose touch turns everything into a product built around a microchip.

Of course not everybody has been able to take part in the buying spree on equal terms. Millions of Americans work long hours at poverty wages while many others can find no work at all. However, as advertisers well know, poverty does not render one immune to the gospel of consumption.

<a href="http://istanbultea.typepad.com/largefellaonabike/2008/05/sometimes-the-i.html">Sometimes the Inside is, Outside...</a>: What am I capable of... how far can, or will, I go to do Right?  Others times, I feel [right or wrong] like I'm doing this to atone for some stupid, crappy thing I've done to someone long forgotten about.  Like an old teacher would tell me when I was teen, "Sometimes you gotta bleed for others... ".

So I go across the street to Skol, buy a bottle of water and a pint of gin, and go back over to the guy in the wheelchair.  In the bag, with the gin &amp; water, I put in some kleenex from my saddle bag, a smallish bag of sunflower seeds and a five dollar bill.  I tuck the whole deal into the guys jacket, after lifting his drooping head off his chest.  His skin feels like dried out leather.  He keeps snoring.

I roll on.

After some more miles, I head back home... and decide to go by that corner again.

He's still there, still sleeping...

...and the bag has fallen out from underneath his jacket.

The pint of gin is broken on the sidewalk, while the bottle of water must have rolled out and onto the street and has been run over by a car or bus. 

I hope the tissues, seeds and money are still in the bag... <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Remarkable. Murphy can be really mean.]</cite> <br />

We got out early on Mother's Day so that Lisa would have some time to herself. True, she was busy prepping for Noah's final 3rd birthday party later in the day, but us being out of the house changes the tempo. So we went to the Lake and rolled around for a while. Then we stopped at home, grabbed some breakfast, and headed out to the Park (read slides ad swings). We were pretty much out of the house the entire morning getting air and sunshine and running around. A great gift for all of us.

By the time I took this picture, Noah had already squirmed out of half his harness, was occasionally snacking on his Bites and sipping from a water bottle, had two plush bears and a blanket with him. He also requested that his red backpack ride along (filled with enough "Noah supplies" for a really tough day (changes of clothes, diapers, wipes, etc., etc.) All in all I was pulling about 65lbs.]]></content:encoded>

Where'd that bike come from? Where's did the steel, scandium, aluminum, carbon fiber, resin, grease, lube, plastic, rubber, cork, paint etc. come from? Who dug it out of the ground, produced a "finished" product and shipped it to be built into that bike? Who again packaged and shipped that bike? How much energy was consumed in the process? How much environmentally harmful stuff was used and discarded? Are the large bike companies any cleaner environmentally than other manufacturing processes? I don't know how many miles have to be ridden before you offset the debt of the build, but it has got to be more than just a few. I know that the same thing is true for a car or truck with their even higher starting points. And that therefore your impact is lower to start... but it's still a long way from zero. And therein lies my point. While riding the heck out of that bike now that it's built, and caring for it so that it lasts a long time, you make the most of the energy spent. However it remains all too easy to climb on a high horse of falsely virtuous eco-righteness. Don't. You've just chosen less, not none. Feel good about that. Help others to do the same. Conservation is a powerful tool. At the same time be understanding of the needs and culture of others. Realize that a bike may be completely foreign to that person, an alien that they have no understanding of or connection to, and remember that we are not outside looking in, but inside, sharing the ride.]</cite> <br />

The ride leader thought to start off with a bucolic scene of a local farm and cows grazing in the fields. Don't let that wall like double climb worry anyone... it's short. Naturally, it completely fractured the group.

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/nct-initial-elevation.png" alt="NCT initial elevation.png" border="0" width="98" height="99">

After spending a long time regrouping (almost) we were heading up the trail. I didn't snapshot the speeds enough to know for sure, but most of the riding was in the 13 - 15 area, and of course, stunting and sprinting, and playing around ensued so there were section cranked up to 28.7 mph while we all goofed around.

I still seem to be bonking after about 18 miles... I'm not sure why. A short rest and some light pedaling is all it takes to revive, but I never noticed it in prior years. Hmmm.

Anyway, it was a beautiful day for a ride, and much fun was had. Thanks always to my sponsor... my lovely wife, who sprung me loose for the day.

I should also point out that the giant blank area on my back could be displaying *your* message, advertising, or company logo. Feel free to get in touch.]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.lethargy.org/~jesus/archives/118-Dissecting-todays-Internet-traffic-spikes.html#comments">Dissecting today's Internet traffic spikes</a>: This, in many ways, is like a tornado. Our ability to predict them sucks. Our responses are crude and they are quite damaging. However, predicting these Internet traffic events isn't even possible -- there are no building weather patterns or early warning signs. Instead we are forced to focus on different techniques for stability and safety. The idea of a DoS, a DDoS or the sometimes similar signature of a sudden popularity spike doesn't increase my heart rate anymore -- it's just another day on the job. However, I thought I'd share the four guidelines that I believe are key to my sanity in these situations <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Good article... from someone who knows. I worked with Theo &amp; Co. back in '00-'01. They do this stuff all day every day.]</cite> <br />

EYE OF THE TIGER!!!". <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Not that long ago I witnessed a similar happening. I was pulling Noah in the trailer, and there were signs and then cops and then hordes of people at the usually quiet park. The signs said "Biathlon" (well, there was a sponsor's name, but they've never done me any favors...). For one split second I wondered who was going to the shooting with images of cyclists jumping off their bikes to take aim at something... and realized that someone was trying their hand at marketing and failing (apparently the name is changing next year to duathlon eliminating my vision and possibly a fatal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon">misunderstanding</a>). Anyway,  so the competitors start arriving in all their racing glory, and behold the always enjoyable sight of someone on a "townie" bike (upright, non-aero position) in shorts and t-shirt, passing someone in full tri gear... skinsuit, aero bars, disk wheel... the works. I burst out laughing, but only Noah heard me, and there was no way to explain... It's not about the bike (or gear).]</cite> <br />

However, when there was traffic in both directions, they passed by a 60 mph with no thought of slowing down, often missing him by inches.

At one time, a large eighteen-wheeler went by, and although it missed him by at least two feet, its shear size, and those huge wheels, gave AJ the scare of his life. And the back draft almost blew him off his feet <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[If more folks would have to get out of their cars and trucks, and for that matter, lived with fewer bits of insulation between each of us the world would be a better place.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://brainspl.at/articles/2008/05/21/merb-slices">merb-slices</a> are &#8220;Little slices of <span class="caps">MVC</span> cake&#8221;. These are self contained merb apps with models, controlers, views and assets that you can distribute as rubygems. You can mount a merb-slice at a specific point in your router definition and you can override any part of the slice up in your main app. So in a way these are similar to what Rails-Engines promise, except merb-slices are built into the framework and will not break when merb itself is updated.

<a href="http://johnaugust.com/archives/2008/does-a-working-writer-keep-improving">Taking Things Apart</a>: 
<p>John August, asked by a working screenwriter how he can keep improving throughout his career:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>My advice for you is to dedicate one day a week to disassembling good movies. Take existing films (and one-hour dramas) and break them down to cards. Think of yourself as an ordinary mechanic given the task of reverse-engineering a spaceship. Figure out what the pieces do, and why they were put together in that way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this true for <em>any</em> craft.</p>
<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[It's a great way to hone one's touch and grow new skills. I especially like doing it as a group exercise to learn what others see in something that I don't.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There'll come a time when the pictures friends send me from their epic vacations (mountain climbing, skiing, frozen biking) will once again appeal. Their crisp blue skies, the carapaces and undulations of the mountain wearing a mantle of whitest snow, the gray, almost smoky clouds hovering low over a brilliant orange or yellow tent, bike wheels packed with snow, and water bottles frozen solid all meant to inspire a longing for a road less traveled. But for now even the notion of cold is entirely lacking in merit in my eyes.

Seriously. I get up fairly early every day. Generally 5AM somethin'. And all autumn, winter and through most of spring that means it's at least chilly outside if not cold as a witches elbow. It makes it hard to get up, hard to get out, and it's really demotivating when what you have to do is not fun. Getting up that early in the cold to go skiing? Doable. Getting up that early to get ready for work and take out the garbage? An effort of will. I rode my bike throughout the winter regardless of temperature or precipitation. I hustled my little family out the door t the ridiculous hour we leave for jobs and school. But I've kinda had it with the cold for now.

So for the time being, if you live in Alaska, or climb in the Himalayas, or are running some program in the Arctic, or Antarctica, please spare the snowy, cold pictures. No matter how beautiful. Wait 'till maybe the end of August or September when the oppressing humidity of a New York summer has kicked in with sufficient strength to cause even the staunchest of summer folks to wilt. By then I'll be toast. Then bring them on!

As always your support is appreciated. (wink)]]></content:encoded>

Now there's lot's more cush and they're smooth rolling. It's a commute, not a race (mostly :~)

I love that the tire dimensions are listed on the package as 622 x 33.33333... you can see the continuation line on the tire itself (below). They make a "Brown" version that is slightly heavier and reinforced.

On the right is my Salsa Casserole in it's current minimalist config, now with the <a href="http://www.rivbike.com/products/list/tires_tubes_pumps_patches?page=2">JB Greens</a>. I got mine through Rivendell, a bastion of practical cycling. 

Below is Andy Hampsten's Strada Bianca Ti. Same tires... but I've never won the Giro. Make of that what you will. Credit for the picture of Andy's bike credit goes to the irrepressible James Huang of <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/">Cyclingnews.com</a>.

Nice synchronicity. I recommend some changes though since if you're copying my life there's a few things that could go better :)

I still do ride them, and they've held up nicely. I also ride two others. The Rolly Polly/Ruffy Tuffy size will work far easier with fenders (on the Cass.) and have most of the same benefits since they are 27c instead of 33.

I've also been riding Challenge Parigi Roubaix's which are 27c but measure out as 28ish and are wonderful if expensive for commuting. They're also fairly light, and for commuting would prolly be a bit more prone to flat, but I've been riding them for sporting purposes (Battenkill, and other rougher road rides, but no the daily grind) and love the supple ride.]]></wp:comment_content>

I came across your site looking for info on the Jack Browns as I'm in need of new tires. And, as fate would have it, I also ride a Casseroll. And have a son named Noah.

Did you like them? Still have them or replace them with the same?

They aren't cheap and I run fenders on mine so clearance is a concern.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://www.zdziarski.com/papers/wipe.html">Nuclear Elephant: iPhone Wipe</a>: Since my posts regarding the iPhone restore mode being insufficient for wiping data (and Apple's own refurbishing process also being insufficient), many have emailed me asking for instructions on how to properly wipe personal data off of the iPhone. I've been very quiet about how to properly lift data in a forensic manner, as my goal is to avoid seeing a bunch of evidence erasers pop up in the wild (I've already been approached by Symantec about this). What I will share, however, is the way in which I wipe my own devices before I resell them, which I believe the consumer has a right to do.

<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CoolTools/~3/299176976/002843.php">SOLAS Marine Reflective Tape</a>: We've been using 3M's SOLAS reflective tape for several years. It was designed for the Coast Guard to use on life jackets, so you know it has to be tough and withstand time, bad weather and wet conditions (SOLAS = safety of life at sea). It is a bit expensive, but it is the brightest and most durable stuff I've ever found. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Hmmm.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/512/wordpress-to-disable-remote-access">WordPress To Disable Remote Access</a>: If this sounds like a pipe dream, it’s worth pointing out that one very popular web service is already employing this strategy, and it works brilliantly. Flickr, Yahoo’s incredibly popular photo sharing site, is built on the very same APIs it makes available to clients. This results in some truly incredible Flickr-enabled applications and web services. And you don’t see any sign of Flickr disabling access to their API, because there’s too much at stake.

If your web service only provides one, first-class API through which all access flows, then you’ve only got one point to secure, you’re likely to have feature parity across interfaces, and the risk of marginalizing one interface is dramatically decreased. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Well put Daniel!]</cite> <br />

Going to meet a friend for lunch the other day it seemed to make sense to grab one, so I (and my boss) did. We got some unrequested help from the platform guy, who in years past would've been stuck in a booth handing out tokens, but now is amongst the people walking then through the steps of putting value into Metrocards.

As we swipe our way through the turnstiles, someone cuts in front of us and jumps the turnstile. He then proceeds to walk down the platform and pees into a corner. He now hears from the platform guy who warns him that the cops are on the way.

The not a joyous member of society saunters off down the platform knowing that a train is going to pull in any second, long before even a close by cop could respond.

All entirely too matter of fact.

Makes wonder about tourism in the City, which I now see daily, as I pass through Times Square.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Articles like <a href="http://hubandspokes.blogspot.com/2008/06/battle-for-central-park.html">this</a> about the "Battle for Central Park", where joggers and runners are forever aggravated at cyclists and vice versa, and everyone hates the car folks and vice versa, don't speak to anything but extreme crowding.

The resources (open space, clear of "traffic" (defined as anything that interrupts *your* activity)) are too scarce. We are constantly jostling each other in our attempt to simply move about. Of course everyone is annoyed! Sadly though, there is a strong sense of entitlement and greed that runs as an undercurrent to the interactions.

I have no answers here, except for my personal one of making a choice to find more space for my family as quickly as possible.]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/biztech/2008/06/25/finding-a-friendly-cloud/">Finding A Friendly Cloud</a>: Jason Hoffman, founder and chief technology officer of a cloud-computing specialist called Joyent, was particularly pointed in warning that Google’s App Engine could represent a lock-in to developers. It is possible to build “a loving cloud,” he argued, that would make it easier to create applications that could be easily moved among different services. Other panelists kept calling Google’s App Engine “proprietary,” which to many techies is equivalent to labeling it both evil and outdated at the same time. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Bring on the loving cloud, people.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/casual-first-ride-on-km.jpg" alt="daniel testing karate monkey build" width="257" height="642" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-318" /> After a weekend with no voice, and the gentle knell of my attempts to clear my throat the predominant sound in the house this weekend, I dropped by the RBC picnic with the as yet untested build of my Karate Monkey. Mostly Deore, a few Ritchey bits, and Avid mechanical brakes, the build is fairly inexpensive and not particularly light. To me that means not worrying about breaking stuff, getting it muddy and wet. I have some bits and pieces in the closet to try, some handlebars, a wheel, etc. and I'll do that slowly over the next few months... but I'll talk about them more when I get them on the bike. It is fun to ride even now.

I'd love to try a truly fat tire like an Endomorph on the front to see what that feels like. Maybe someone has a Pugsley or something in the area?

I was dressed casually (even sloppily) for the picnic, which explains the running shoes... but it was really humid and hot out, especially the spot where the picnic was held. When we went for a ride around the lake, it was obvious that there were much cooler spots. The club is raising funds by taking portraits of members with their bikes. I have every intention of doing this, but yesterday was not the day I intended to do it. Between my cold and the heat, the lack of caring about the way I dressed... I was a site. Nonetheless, pictures were taken by <a href="http://davidjschloss.typepad.com/">David</a>, and naturally I look awful. Awful! No matter. I do enjoy the pictures of my playing photo apprentice and NBA style sweat mopper as seen <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rocklandbike/2623869274/sizes/o/in/pool-526397@N20/">here</a> for my riding pal <a href="http://butterflybike.blogspot.com/">Jenni</a>. I can't wait to do this for real (the picture part, not the apprentice part) with Lisa &amp; Noah.

A few of us who brought bikes decided to loop the lake. I ride a road bike so much of the time nowadays that in trying to navigate around the families that sometimes clog the path, I'm reluctant to run on the dirt. There I am hesitating, checking out the dirt looking to see if it is firm enough when a fat tire angel (or is that fat and tired angel? Whatever... :~) whispers in my ear that to stop looking and just go. Hah! So much for skinny tires.

After one loop the picnic crashed to a close with a thunderstorm and copious amounts of rain. Fun!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.hashrocket.com/blog/comments/crummy_breadcrumbs/#When:16:04:00Z">Crummy &#45; Tasty Breadcrumbs Plugin</a>: I have worked on many applications that require breadcrumbs. Every time, one of the developers has built a quick custom solution. Finally, I decided that we needed a complete solution that we could easily add to future projects, and thus <a href="http://github.com/zachinglis/crummy/">Crummy</a> was born.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The end of the Great Clif Mojo bar Taste Test is near. You can't rush a taste test, nor can you rush greatness. Put them together... and well things can take a while. That's the way it goes. Below is Seth's brief comments on the various flavors.

Pay attention now... because Seth's really cool. And here's why: <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/fundraising/how-to-pmc.html">For six years Seth has been riding in the Pan Mass Challenge</a>, raising serious amounts of money for the Jimmy Fund at Dana-Farber. Last year (2007) they collectively raised 33,000,000 dollars. Seth himself has raised $23,845.94 to date. Righteous! So go right now and help him raise more money this than ever. I'll wait...

<a href="https://www.pmc.org/egifts/makeadonation.asp?egiftID=SD0086">Click here</a> to raise money for the Jimmy Fund at Dana-Farber.

One last thing... the software development community supports Seth's efforts and gives software which he in turns auctions off. Besides feeling really great about yourself for donating, you can also score some <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/fundraising/pmcsoftware/">awesome software</a> (scroll down).

Thanks! Now about those Mojo bars, if you need to catch up here's a reverse chronological list:

<li><a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2008/01/31/raising-the-clif-bar/">Raising the (Clif) bar</a></li>
</ul>


The reason the GCBMTT is almost done is simply because I (purposely) never completed my own reviews of the products. Undue influence and all. So that'll be coming up in the next week or so. Meanwhile, keep reading and get your Mojo on!

<a href="http://www.truerwords.net/6211">The Great Mojo Bars Taste Test</a>: "It's been a few months since I tried them, and I'd be lying if I said I could remember the names of all of the flavors. Instead, I looked up the names in one of Daniel's old posts. Once I saw the names, I did at least remember what I thought of the bars.

Mixed Nuts: Eh. About what you'd expect. Tasted like mixed nuts, but in bar shape.</br>
Fruit Nut Crunch: I liked this one.</br>
Mountain Mix: Eh. So-so.</br>
Chocolate Peanut: Very tasty. Two great tastes that taste great together, and I've always been a sucker for a Reese's.</br>
Honey Roasted Peanut: I was expecting (or at least hoping for) the taste of Planter's honey-roasted peanuts, but it isn't really like that. It's more like really sweet peanuts.</br>
Peanut Butter Pretzel: If I remember this one correctly, then it's one of the four I would buy again. Sweet and salty.</br>
Peanut Butter and Jelly: This had one of the best flavors, but could have a used a touch of salt.</br>

I'm still not a fan of granola bars during bike rides, but I do like to have one at least 30 minutes before heading out. Unfortunately, Mystic Cycle doesn't carry them, so I need to talk them into picking some up for me if I'm going to make them part of my daily routine."

Seth, I hope Mystic helps you get your Mojo on! Thanks for taking part.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I figured... thanks for the confirmation. Great idea... But what is cool is that folks like Mike Curiak's wheel building, Jeff Jones' frames, Sweetpea, etc. are where more people can find them.

Maybe someone will be inspired to race the GDR, or the frozen races in Alaska that Mike started or holds the records for... or someone will discover Jeff's amazing space frame bikes, or just get a sweet ride built for them by Natalie.

Or find your fund raising and be inspired to do more.

That rocks.]]></wp:comment_content>

<a href="http://ngadventure.typepad.com/blog/2008/07/deep-survival-1.html">How to Survive (Almost) Anything</a>: Take tasks that require no thought and re-invent them so that you have to think. This bears repeating: Survival is not about equipment and training alone. It’s about what’s in your mind and your emotional system. Living in a low-risk environment dulls our abilities. We must make a conscious effort to learn new things, to force ourselves out of our comfort zones. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[This applies to so many things... despite our deep desire to create continuity in our lives, it is best for us if things keep changing and we keep learning and adapting. It's better from almost every view point I can think of (diet, exercise, thought, etc., etc.) It's the same lesson I learned as a musician years ago. Adaptation is something that can be practiced.]</cite></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't disagree with the automate "no thought" tasks concept, but that's not the same as training your brain for adaptation by doing complex things like writing with your "weak" hand, or working on a skill that you're poor at in order to get better at it.

If the purpose of "making more work" of something is to learn (and practice adaptation) then it not "waste" but a value choice which seems to me is perfectly in line with goal of agile (adaptation to changing values).

I don't see how there can even be a "true agile coaching spin" but maybe I don't understand what you mean by that.]]></wp:comment_content>

Take "no thought" tasks and automate them so you don't have to do them anymore.  This creates time to do new life-invigorating tasks.

(I get the point of your post and agree, I just saw the agile tag and wanted to put the true agile coaching spin on it.)]]></wp:comment_content>

<a href="http://goodexperience.com/2008/07/following-up-on-these.php">Secrets of book publishing I wish I had known</a>:  Following up on these <a href="http://goodexperience.com/2008/06/three-good-overviews.php">overviews of the book industry</a>, I thought I'd share some lessons I learned from publishing <a href="http://bitliteracy.com"><i>Bit&nbsp;Literacy</i></a>. I originally tried to go through mainstream publishers but eventually self-published it, because of what I learned in the process. <b>I wish I had known everything below before I wrote my book.</b> <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I find similarities everywhere here... finding work or a job, finding gigs as a musician, working with local retail outlets, etc., etc. When it comes to people doing stuff, no one is interested in you but you. And if someone is interested (read, seemingly willing to help you), it is a sure sign that they see some way you can make them money, or help them, or generally for them to get something out of whatever they intend to do (see<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We're_Only_in_It_for_the_Money"> Frank Zappa</a>). I don't mean to sound so cynical, there's a lot of cases where this isn't true, and in fact I see nothing wrong with it. Understanding people's motives means dealing honestly and openly. Pretending, misleading, or outright lying is far worse. Be up front about what you're going to get and it'll work out.]</cite> <br />

That's right... there's 6 to almost 11% grades. Not long, but steep. It should be noted that I was dropping off my wife's car for service so the downhill direction was, of course, done in the car. Ain't that always the way.]]></content:encoded>

A recent survey of U.K. office workers showed that most don't feel it's their responsibility to make their workplace greener. But most offices squander massive amounts of energy -- and if we worker types don't change that, who will? Today we offer tips for greening your day job, from the time you clock in until the supper bell rings.<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[It's a start...]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some people will never be considered "experienced". To become experienced, one must reflect upon experiences and attempt to draw understanding from them. "This didn't work out, this did. Hmmm? Why is that?" Failure to inspect our experiences leads no where.

You can also get ahead of the curve. "What do I think I should do in this situation? What am I capable of doing? where do they intersect? What does this more experienced and or capable person think? Does that change anything significant?" This is the nature of thoughtfulness.

So with these two simple notions at hand explain to me dear reader why no one pulled through on my ride this morning for over a 10 mile stretch into a headwind? I waved, I pulled out, I slowed... nothing. It's was like watching one of the TDF breakaways falls apart where it has become everyone for themselves. Ya know, the guys in back never pull through? I would pull out and slow, everyone else would slow. I'd pull out and wave... nothing. Slowly extremely would bring questions of "Are you OK?". Sigh. I'm fine. Keep pedaling! There was no reason someone else couldn't stick their nose in the wind. A couple of folks were clearly being lazy, they had no problem sprinting ahead when they felt motivated. Quite a few had no problem pulling when we turned and the wind was longer in our faces. A couple of folks were probably inexperienced and haven't been taught proper etiquette. Hopefully, they'll go home and wonder about these moments and at least think "What was that about?"

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/ride-with-sheryl.png" alt="ride_with_sheryl.png" border="0" width="432" height="163" />

33 miles, almost 1000ft of climbing, an average speed of 13.4 that is really a lie ( well no, it's not in the sense that I'm sure it is the average for all movement on the ride, but that includes the dinkying around the parking lots and city streets... so I pawed through the graph for the "on the road sections" and sure enough even the uphill averages were over 15 with some sections in the low 20's.

The next annoyance was when I realized that a so called "expert", an expert by virtue of nothing more than experience, put my wife's bike rack together wrong, with some critical parts installed backward. My analysis is that in this case the person hasn't built many of this model rack, and it was a misreading of the instructions, but I was surprised at how things went when I tried to put a bike on the rack. Something was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Yesterday I saw a picture of the same rack and in just one second it became clear which parts had been installed wrong, and now it all makes far more sense, and works properly. The failure here is that someone who should be used to this (the so called expert) rushed the job. He should be used to working with customers waiting, he does it all the time. I was in no particular rush, and wasn't hovering (on purpose). So it's just sloppiness.

We can make a choice about the quality and nature of our work. We can be present and demand a level quality that we will not forego. To me it is essential to constantly be aware of this. I don't always get to work to the quality level I wish, there are other constraints on my work such as time, cost, and my own ability to execute. What I cannot and do not give up is the awareness of those decisions, how they are made and why, and allow some lesser level than I desire become assumed and routine. I am aware of my decisions, my experience, and I will not release my thoughtfulness to the best of my ability.]]></content:encoded>

New things pop up in several places at once. In this case a friend with whom I often pass design ideas, sites, and writing sent me a link to the design of <a href="http://billykirkcom.blogspot.com/2008/02/blog-post.html">a token he liked</a>, and another blog pointed me to <a href="http://freemantransport.blogspot.com/2008/06/bag-for-your-bike.html">Freeman Transport</a> who making a fixie bike with S&amp;S couplers and <a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_ivsfSim8PXI/SGkZuSVQTiI/AAAAAAAAAMk/jG6M7_qZpn8/s1600-h/bag+1.jpg">a bag to match</a>. The bag looks like the work of Billykirk, which a few days I never would have known. There's a link on the sidebar... cool.

Anyway, the designs are interesting, and I heard from Chris Bray when I wrote about a future product, and we've been passing design ideas back and forth. Cool. I love the understated simplicity coupled with handworked quality that seems to be the hallmark of their designs. Personally, I like the No. 123 Shoulder Pouch and from the Preview page, the item I wrote to Chris about the No. 206 'Green' Giant Shopper. (Bergundy? Oh yeah...)

And to my biking friends, Freeman Transport will be selling the bag by itself.]]></content:encoded>

I have a new wheel. It's got a blingy Chris King singlespeed hub in red. But wait you say, it looks like there's gears on there? And Hmmm. 6 of them? Strange. The idea is to build a very strong and stiff wheel, so <a href="http://jonesbikes.com/blog/?p=206">Jeff Jones</a> reworks an cassette to create a 34 -17 set, designed around using a singlespeed hub so that there's no offset. The wheel is built with equally tensioned spokes. It also makes it super easy to convert to a single speed should I desire. Nice. All part of the WOC(WD) (see the title).

Allez!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't know... I am apparently light on my wheels.

I routinely ride a wheelset that is 18 front/20 back with no problems. I don't know that they'll last years and years, but I've never folded one, broken a spoke, etc. and I check for cracks etc. fairly frequently. I admit that I'm still becoming a strong rider, use high pressure, and think light thoughts.

I do run significantly heavier wheels during the winter when the roads are worse, and when you can't always see the holes...

That said this beauty is a 32 spoke wheel. Additionally, because it is designed around the single speed hub it is not dished. So it is a stiffer and stronger rear wheel than standard rear wheel.]]></wp:comment_content>

Environmental constraints, because they impel us to reduce waste and narrow our choices in raw materials and trims, also help us improve the business’s bottom line. When we reduce complexity, we allow ourselves to focus our efforts on greater innovations. We’ve learned that in reality, unlimited choice ultimately drives up costs. The ‘Live Simply’ mantra turns out to be more than a nice bumper-sticker slogan; it’s sound business advice. Time and again we’ve learned that when we do the right thing we end up doing well.<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[The project I'm working on is just starting to learn this lesson...

</a>. Sure, there was griping, but that is to be, er um, expected. (And I do my fair share as conditions warrant.) However there's parts to the tory that Jenni did not tell. I've been on countless rides where the path was hers we've I've heard over and over "That's the last hill..." only to find yet another hill just around the corner. The other part is that she really did have an invasive procedure from which she isn't healed, so we took it slow. Now that has two effects. It makes some hills harder, and roughness of the road bothered her more than the effort. So the weather was cool, she isn't healed, we took it slow, and there was some grade.

I should add that I was almost dressed right at the beginning... arms warmers, knee warmers and a vest helped protect from the chill. My arms started out feeling colder than I would have hoped. Everything else was fine, and I even had to roll down the warmers before we were through.

Allez!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/picture-1.png" alt="Picture 1.png" border="0" width="331" height="610" align="left" />6:13am this morning I was already in Piermont, and starting my ride. Nasty for a weekend, but that's the price I pay for having a full life. No real complaints... except it is seriously cold these days in the morning. And dark. Like, no going anywhere without lights dark. Fortunately traffic is light at that hour on Sunday. However, you can't really relax, because the folks who are up at that hour seem generally annoyed that they have to be up at that hour on Sunday. Maybe surly would be a better description.

On a similar ride last week, I was feeling terrible. That is, I kept looking down at the speedo and seeing really low numbers. 9mph, 12mph and I felt I was working really hard. At first I chalked it up to the early hour. Then I got worried my ride partner would get annoyed at the pace and pick it up, and really I felt like I couldn't really go a whole lot faster for very long. Strange I thought, that I have so little this day, but it happens sometimes (usually a mental thing) and since my ride partner was not complaining about the pace... who cares?

We get to the bottom of  our loop and after a small climb we hit a gradual but long downhill section... one where we almost always enjoy gravity and push for whatever we've got. So off we go and I'm feeling like it should when we're cruising at 24mph or so... except I look down at the speedo and 16.5, 17... Huh? not possible. There's a permanent radar installation near a school we were just about to pass. I look up and sure enough 24 or so. Aha! Hey, Jenni! What does your speedo say? 23 or so Why? Tell ya later...

So here's the payoff. After the last ride I commented to Jenni how slow the avg. speed had been on the ride. So she had tried hard to pay attention to the pace and keep things moving. (I, of course, thought I was going to collapse moving at what I thought was only 12mph.) Naturally, the speedo was set wrong for the previous ride also (the wheel size was set wrong). So she pushed because she wanted me to have a good ride, and I pushed the pace because I thought I was moving at a snails pace with the end result being one of the fastest rides of the year. Silly. And it leads me to this.

I often ride without any "data" like a speedo. I don't have one on every bike. And there is something to be said for that. You trust your feelings entirely with no other gauge available. Now I enjoy seeing the numbers and having the data. Measurement is one of the few ways to ensure progress. But times like this make me want to ditch the thing entirely. All of us had a good chuckle about it though.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So say what you will about the value of your web framework of choice, but I and someone I work with (who never used this particular framework) built a useable section of an app and deployed to production in two weeks. Now we had some advantages. We had worked together before for about 8 months. My partner is really smart. I have some experience with the framework. Things that were working against us. We had very little time to produce the first useable bit of functionality. We don't have our dev environment set up. We don't have the proper test and QA structure in place yet and we were using a significantly advanced version of the framework since the last bit of development I had done with it.

Still, <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and it's community is powerful stuff. A couple of plugins, a bit of spelunking via Google, and our own understanding of web frameworks made it possible to crank out some great stuff. Even now, as we start week 4, the code is getting tighter and more Ruby like. I can't wait to see where we're at in six months and beyond.

It's been amazing.

Some common stuff we're enjoying:

<a href="http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/wikis">will_paginate</a>

Thanks to the community for solving so many problems in advance.

Allez!

We're looking forward to getting some of our solutions and ideas written up and coded for more general use. We have a public repository, and as soon as we can, we hope to start giving back.]]></content:encoded>

We have few "we-started-them" family traditions. Family traditions abound on both sides, but there are few we feel are our own. Apple/Pumpkin picking is one. Even that is fairly hazy in that everyone else has done it as well, but we try and do it every year which apparently counts for something somewhere, in some ledger of family tradition, or so I'm told, and leave me alone already etc.

Fruit off a tree is magical. It's not from a bin in a store. It's not handled by others. It's not processed, folded, spindled, or mutilated as the post office is want to say. One second it's part of tree and the next second it's a snack, or a pie, or the promise of one. Magic I tell you.

It can be very hard to get out 5:30am on a Sunday morning this time of year. It's dark, it's cold, and generally not pleasant. Worse, you know it's going to be much warmer and brighter later... when I can't usually ride because of other obligations. That leaves me with a mostly mental battle — like my ride yesterday started out at 36 degrees F. Still some actual preparation takes place... I changed wheels on my road bike to a stronger wheel with rubber that has a bit more tread to it on the corners. The strength comes in handy hopping over fallen branches etc. The next step is over to the truly fat road tires (which requires a change of bike -- heh). Clothing got sorted and cleaned. Gloves have gone from fingerless, to light, to medium. We've quickly blown through arm and leg warmers in the early morning,  that season has passed already for me. But all in all, it's mostly getting ready for the freezing cold starts, and often colder feeling finishes. It's also remembering to bring something to blow one's nose with, and taking a moment now and again to do so. That makes cold weather riding far more comfortable for me.</p><p>Below, a new set of King cages, featherweight titanium bottle cages made from "left over" titanium tubing from the airline industry.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/ramble.png" alt="ramble.png" border="0" width="320" height="299" align="left" />A bunch of friends got together to ride on a glorious fall day. I met Gerry early to get in some additional miles, and as always, appreciate his experience and insight. Gerry, for all the teasing he takes is a remarkable athlete who has ridden well over 100,000 miles this decade. And that doesn't begin to include his running or anything else. Fortunately for me Gerry is an early riser, and since I almost always have to ride early in the day, I can often catch up with him somewhere, and often he's already been riding for a while. I'm not sure how far he had gone this morning before he met with me, but I had layered up and was ready. We spun out and had a nice pre ride spin, and caught up a bit. He's been competing in a number of events and doing rather well.

Back at <a href="http://www.piermontbike.com/">Piermont</a>, I said hello to the guys, checked up on a couple of little things and then headed out with the group. A lovely bunch of folks, including one person who has been rehabbing for a while and is finally back on their bike, and in a related way I learned that someone who I've known for a while (just as smartest and lovely person as you could wish to meet, Hi Rita!) lives around the corner from me. I can't begin to count how many times I must have ridden by her house.

Anyway, today was the perfect day for a rambling ride, enjoying the beautiful fall light, the leaves, and the crisp clean air. Add a great bunch of folks... and it's magic.

I also completely ripped up two town line sprints after getting toasted by Jenni with the excuse that (wait for it...) I didn't know we were competing until after she blew by me.

And below... one more piece of soon to be acquired winter gear... although I intend to get the 183 version for the front.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/autumn.jpg" alt="Leaves begin to change color along the Swift River in the White Mountain National Forest in Albany, N.H., Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2008.(AP Photo/Jim Cole)" border="0" width="360" height="230" align="left">So it's looking a lot like this (an AP photo by Jim Cole) around here these days. The days are bright with autumn sunshine, the air is crisp and clean. I can't say enough about this time of year... except when I get up to ride at 5:30am. This morning it was 32 degrees F... also known as freezing. And a bit breezy. The problem is that after a few hours it can be significantly warmer out, and you need to figure the layers and compressibility, so that you might be able to shed something later, and stick in a pocket.

This morning I guessed wrong. And I payed the price. We had a nice route going, where there is this nice steady climb. Especially this time of year, it kicks my butt. But that's what I'm out there for, so that was fine. Sure, Gerry felt the need to inquire of my plans for succession at the top of a long climb, but fear not. I've been there before, just not quite under dressed for the weather like today.

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/nov-2-gerry-route.png" alt="nov_2_gerry_route.png" border="0" width="360" height="286" align="right" />The kicker is when I dress too lightly and then climb, it costs me. First, I'm cold starting the climb. I feel weak and small. Then I warm up, and start to sweat. All fine until you reach the usually joyful downhill. Now it's just freezes that sweat to your body, and makes you feel exceptionally cold. In more serious weather it's a great way to get hypothermic. Today, it was just annoying, but made me cut my intended ride short. I did find a balance again when we took a short break and I stood in the sun for a few minutes. The rest, the sun, and then a nice pace brought me back to comfortable enough, but the ride had been long enough and uncomfortable enough that I didn't feel like continuing. 24 uncomfortable miles. Here's the thing. Despite all the whining and all about my screwing up a ride, it was a glorious fall day for ride. The light is amazing, the leaves are spectacular, the neighborhoods we ride through are well kept and quaint. The folks I ride with all the time always have interesting topics and trivia to discuss, and never seem to have an agenda about well, just about anything on the rides. Just one more layer... one more layer.

(Two other mistakes I made today... thinking it would be warmer since it was "an hour later", and "I should be wide awake" since it was "an hour later". Not so much on either count.)]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Workling, BackgroundJob, and some config file and UTC caution.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the features of the software I'm building is the ability to upload images and other binary files. Like so many other Rails apps we're using <a href="http://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu/tree/master">attachment_fu</a>. So far so good. We expected the "client" could pull these assets when they needed them and store them wherever they desired. And the developers rejoiced.

A follow up story required that we move those assets over to the website via SFTP. Since we use <a href="http://www.capify.org/">Capistrano</a> I wrapped Net::SFTP (a Capistrano dependency). We wired it into the Model via after_save, and after_destroy, and again the developers rejoiced.

I decided to move the "hard coded" user, pass, etc. stuff to a config file, so created a <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> file and added the aforementioned sftp stuff, and some other application specific that was crufting up the place. I created an initializer to load the file,  and again the... yeah, ok, you got it. Soon after there was some stuff that was environment specific so I created the 3 basic environment sections (development, production, and test) and moved along. I figured I could test for them in just one spot (for now) and all would be good. I've since had a change of heart, but no matter for now.

A short while later I accidently demo'ed the new transfer code with a very large image file, and was less than impressed by the way it went. Since Rails is single threaded (still, for the moment, although about to change as I write this) the file transfer absorbed copious resources on this somewhat long lived transfer. Genius that I am, I said we should run the transfer as a background process, and since I know we have other similar requirements coming up Real Soon Now(tm), decided to implement a queue as well. After looking around the landscape I decided on <a href="http://github.com/purzelrakete/workling/tree/master">Workling</a> and <a href="http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/bj">BackgroundJob</a>. It looked like they would play nicely, and keep thing clean and straightforward.

In go the plugins, get things setup and migrated, create a worker class, and fire off the MyWorker.asynch_test_method. Cool! I see stuff in the database... hmmm nothing happened. I'm going to skip through the process at this point, and just discuss what we (I was pairing with <a href="http://www.evanclosson.com/">Evan</a> during most of this) found.

One of the recent changes in Rails (we started with 2.1 and have since moved to 2.1.2 as I write this) includes control over Time Zones. We had talked and played around with this a bit and decided that for our purposes UTC was just fine, and so left the default setting. Stuff in the database gets stored as UTC and when everything works as expected is converted to a local time setting, if you set one. Here's the first gotcha. Since this is fairly new, folks have liberally sprinkled libraries with calls to Time.now(). Which is fine for what it is, but at least with the version of Ruby we're using (1.8.6 as I write this) returns local time... but the database is living over in UTC land. I wouldn't notice if my time zone was Greenwich Mean, but over here on the East Coast of the US there's a five hour difference. So we hunted down (not for the first time mind you) the use of Time.now in the BJ runnner.rb an changed it to Time.now.utc. One bug down.

The next one was bug in the bj_invoker.rb that is installed by Workling in the script folder. Stuff happens (and a patch is being submitted) but there's a bit of meta-programming going on, and it was hard to find the places where STDOUT was being nullified, and because it's trying to act as background or async process, exceptions are being swallowed. So no significant logging, and no exceptions. In the end we patched the runner code in BJ to display STDERR and STDOUT, and we wrapped a method call in a begin/rescue in Workling to enable some exception logging at least in this common case.

Having done that we found our error, fixed our bugs, and watched everything work. And the developers rejoiced.

The lessons so far: Developers do not pay enough attention to time zones so watch for gotchas like how time is being stored in your database vs. how you test for time stuff. Secondly, only the main path will be well worn. All others will have bumps. Workling is commonly used with Starling and so using with other, even supported libs may be a somewhat more bug laden experience than one would hope for. This wasn't too bad, but the process was methodically annoying and to a degree, orthogonal to our goals.

So... next we have the config file caution. So there's this nice thing known as the Rails environment. It's a beautiful thing as it makes it easy to separate development from testing and production. You can point each environment to a unique database. Excellent! You can change key settings about caching, and reloading of classes that makes development smoother and production faster. Yay! So what's the caution? While those three are standard folks make up others. In addition to those three we have two others which are not common. They serve they're purpose, but they're not conventional.

Today I had a deploy fail. Hmm, that's odd, they're usually so smooth. Migration failed... nothing strange in there. Hmm there's a couple of lines about config files... so what it turned out to be were two plugins that each rely on a config file. In one case the developers did the right thing and when they could not find a config file section that matched the environment, shut themselves down and wrote about it in the log. Excellent! The second was seriously hard wired to the config file, and so tossed an unhandled exception when it couldn't find the matching environment section. Worse, the config file isn't necessary for the setup we used, and the docs say it can be removed. (It can't, for the same reason). So an unnecessary config file, missing an unnecessary environment hung my deploy. Sad. But it made me realize that I was missing those sections in my own little config file, so I added them in there as well, and have a card to rewrite the loading code to ensure that we always do the right thing if the environment section is not there.

A coupe more... it's worthwhile in your Capistrano deploy stuff to be able to run migrations with --trace turned on. You should have matching environments on your development machine as you do elsewhere... I know I do... now. Lastly, as much as possible have a match to your production environment where you can make a mess without consequence. We use VMWare to slice up a hefty machine, and it's a great tool for the purpose. It doesn't hurt that we use <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">Engineyard</a> as our host and so can use the <a href="http://express.engineyard.com/">Express</a> vm for testing.

<a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/44-merb-resources-1318.html#comments">Merb 1.0 Released So Here’s 44 Links and Resources To Get You Going</a>: <p><img src="http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/merb.png" width="137" height="55" alt="merb.png" style="float:left;margin-right:12px;margin-bottom:12px;" /><a href="http://www.merbivore.com/">Merb</a> - a much heralded, highly flexible Ruby-based Web application framework - has <a href="http://brainspl.at/articles/2008/11/08/merb-1-0">reached version 1.0</a> after two years of development. Congratulations to Merb's creator, Ezra Zygmuntowicz, and to the large group of associated developers (such as Yehuda Katz and Matt Aimonetti) who've kept adding features and pushed Merb forward to be a significant alternative to Rails.</p>
<p>Ruby Inside has been some surveys for the past couple of months, and they still show that only 25% of Ruby Inside's visitors have ever developed a Merb application. With the stability that the 1.0 release offers (older versions of Merb had a reputation - fair or not - for a constantly shifting API), it's now a great time to give Merb a try. It's also a great time to get into writing tutorials and documentation!</p>
<h3>Quick Start</h3>
<p>Install Merb from Rubyforge: <span style="font-family:0;">gem install merb</span></p>
<p>If you'd rather go from Merb's "edge" repository: <span style="font-family:0;">gem install merb --source http://edge.merbivore.com</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Make sure that you are running RubyGems 1.3.0 or higher (run <code>gem -v</code> to check). If not, you need to upgrade (I found <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/166853#732427">this page</a> very useful for doing that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follow a tutorial such as <a href="http://merb.4ninjas.org/">Life On The Edge with Merb, DataMapper &amp; RSpec</a>, <a href="http://www.socialface.com/slapp/">Slapp: A Simple Chat Wall Merb Tutorial</a> or <a href="http://www.devx.com/webdev/Article/39735">Move Over Rails. Here Comes Merb.</a></p>
<p>Once you're ready to roll, bookmark this page for safe keeping and read on for our Merb resources! We've divided them up into sections to make it easier. Some will also be left in the comments by other readers!</p>
<h3>Merb News and Community Sites</h3>

The confluence of "her side of the bed" and the shoulder surgery made it extremely painful to pick up a glass to have something to drink. So I grabbed my Camelbak, hung it over the post of her bed, and left the tube on the other side where she could reach it pain free. Not only is it easier to handle, but you can adjust the height easily. While Eldon was ingenious, he was not breaking new ground, as I doubt I was, even back then.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/ck-hubs.jpg" alt="ck_hubs.jpg" border="0" width="432" height="324" align="left" /> This morning became a fat tire festival as I put the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=Schwalbe+Big+Apples&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Schwalbe Big Apples</a> on the Gordo rims (that's a 2.35 tire on a 35mm rim... yow!) It feels almost like snow bike territory.

I've been looking forward to trying out these low pressure boys for a while, and it looks like maybe by the weekend I'll be able to make that happen.

On another set set of wheels (with smaller Mavic rims) went the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=Ritchey+ExcaVader&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Ritchey ExcaVaders</a>... a nice 35c tire with, in my experience, a fairly aggressive tread (from a road riding perspective). I don't expect to run these on the road, I have smoother rolling tires to do that with, but I'm thinking it going to be muddy and wet and that the trails might be fun with these again, so I'm breaking them out. We'll see.
<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/img-0698.jpg" alt="IMG_0698.jpg" border="0" width="240" height="320" align="right" />

There's an awful lot of conversation about <a href="http://www.balloonbikes.com/en/startseite/">tires width and design</a>, rim width and design, but I've decided to go wide this year. I'm evan changing the width of the road rims I'll be riding in the spring to a 23mm rim. I'm feeling like the shorter sidewall, flatter contact patch is working for me. As I've mentioned before I've been using tires as <a href="http://www.schwalbetires.com/balloon_bikes">pneumatic suspension</a> on my commuting bike, and I've grown fond of it. But it's a different kind of riding. I'm curious to see what fat and tall Big Apples are like in more aggressive road riding. Will they feel slow? Will they take two blocks to crank up to speed but once there float and flow? Dunno. Yet. I'll be trying them on a couple of bikes including the premier of the weapon of choice::winter division.

I feel like the weather is going to turn this week... and the road bike will go away for the winter, and the disc brakes and fat tires will rule until spring. Winter is not far away...<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/ritchey-excavaderson-ck-hubs.jpg" alt="ritchey_excavaderson_ck_hubs.jpg" border="0" width="360" height="417" align="left" />]]></content:encoded>

I settled on integrating <a href="http://datamapper.org/">DataMapper</a> with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>.  Seemed like a nice enough thing to do.  Searching for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=datamapper+on+rails">datamapper on rails</a> on Google gave me a link to <a href="http://blog.boldr.fr/posts/datamapper-0-9-avec-rails">DataMapper 0.9 avec Rails</a> (<a href="http://translate.google.ca/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.boldr.fr%2Fposts%2Fdatamapper-0-9-avec-rails&#38;sl=fr&amp;%2338;tl=en&amp;%2338;hl=fr&amp;%2338;ie=UTF-8">Google translation</a>).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/img-0703.jpg" alt="IMG_0703.JPG" border="0" width="216" height="162" align="left" style="margin-right:7px;">The <a href="http://www.jonesbikes.com">Jones</a> frameset arrived... and was as quickly as possible unpacked and assembled. Jenni came over to help, bring gifts from her recent trip to Portland to do a fitting and talk with <a href="http://butterflybike.blogspot.com/2008/11/portland-part-ii_25.html">Natalie Ramsland</a>.

Noah was naturally underfoot as he loves helping, building, tools and pretty much anything of mine, so a shiny new bike is premo. Jenni rapidly included "hammer prevention" to her list of tasks, as Noah believes that the hammer is the tool of choice for virtually any situation. We tried to get him to only hammer the rubber tires, but a few spokes and frame bits got tapped. Fortunately he's already learned not to hammer with all his strength when he's not sure he's allowed to be hammering at all... he comes by all this honestly as I grew up seeing the results of my hammering the dining room table (tiny little half moon divots in one corner) and sawing through the wicker arm of the living room chair. Apparently, I had tools that were more "real" than Noah's plastic hammer, or little wood puzzle piece hammer. There are some things you can't outrun.

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/noah-by-jenni-small.jpg" alt="noah_by_jenni_small.jpg" border="0" width="288" height="216" align="right">

The outcome of all this fun and assembly can be seen here, on top of my car. The picture is post facto as it was fairly dark when I set out. We had our own little "cranksgiving" festival as we said goodbye to Gerry, one of our favorite ride partners who's headed south for a few months (to where he rides more miles than I do all year) while he participated in the Turkey Trot, a five mile race around the lake. We stood around talking, joking and generally goofing around, and still managed to mix 11 miles of riding in there. We even rode amongst the racers (race is relative term here), where we both realized some personal progress as riding up this one little steep behind walkers showed some strength and bike control. It wasn't even hard... a few years ago I'm sure I couldn't have done it at all.

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/jones-on-car.jpg" alt="jones_on_car.jpg" border="0" width="288" height="216" align="left" style="margin-right:7px;">

As for the bike? It's a great ride. Riding on the road it quietly minds its own business. The ride is refined and gentle. No doubt in part  because of the Schwalbe Big Apples Jeff recommended for this purpose. Those are some serious balloon tires, but the frame supports the concept as well. The balance and geometry of the bike come alive when you have the slightest bit of "trail". Hop a curb, absorb  a pothole, do anything that asks anything of the frame it responds. It has that "cry of delight" that best bikes all seem to have. They all scream "Let's go!" as you begin to ask something of them. I've never hopped curbs, swooped up and down little rises or ridden such a responsive bike in those circumstances. It's effortless. I can't wait to put some knobbies on and hit a real trail...

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/gerry-daniel-turkey-trot-sm1.png" alt="gerry_daniel_turkey_trot_sm.png" border="0" width="288" height="300" align="right" />

Jenni was on her road bike... and after negotiating the road apples left by the Clydsdales the mounted Sheriffs left behind (nothing like fresh, steaming, horse poop to remind one that the addition of cars to cities was driven by more than just advancing technology.) So we're winding our way through the back of the race, and decide that this was one of our less ingenious ideas... and we bail through a back parking lot.  The lots in this state park do not get a ton of care and so are very broken up. And while Jenni gingerly picked a line through the broken pavement I rolled with one hand on the bar, talking with her (all right, taunting would be more accurate) since the Jones, equipped as it with the fat tires, and Jeff's build of the brakes with a combination of Nokon and stainless steel tube housing made for one finger/one hand control of the hill we were on.

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/picture-1.png" alt="Picture 1.png" border="0" width="288" height="187" align="left">

But it was really before and after the ride that I learned the most about what this might be capable of... even in my hands. I parked in a lot that has a short rise just as you leave the north corner. I was impressed by how easily the bike climbed it on the way out, considering the tires are essentially slicks and the icy morning dew, but on the way back I let the bike have the drop and it was smooth and controlled and in that effortless manner it displays. Sure, I rode a rigid mountain bike for a long, long time. On the road and off. So there is a certain amount of "home coming" riding this bike. But there is a controlled, facile, manner that was exactly missing from the dually I built 2 years ago. It's early days, and I have lot of learning to do, but I'm impressed with Jeff's design, and am looking forward to it becoming an old friend. Jenni asked me what the "point" of this bike is for me. My answer is "adventure bike". The adventure has begun.

In this picture we are already frozen, as we waited to take a picture of Gerry running by... the wind was blowing, there was no sun. Bah. Thus, my lame attempt at a smile.]]></content:encoded>

I've been personally affected by Cancer this year, although thankfully not to myself, or my immediate family. But it surrounds me... family, friends, co-workers... it's everywhere.

Anyway... I appreciate if you can do something to help. Please click <a href="http://philly09.livestrong.org/daniel">here</a> and donate what you can.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/hed-ardennes.jpg" alt="hed_ardennes.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="208" align="right" />A while back I took the <a href="http://www.roadbikereview.com/cat/wheels/wheelsets/mavic-inc/PRD_366913_2490crx.aspx">Mavic Kyserium ES</a> wheels off my bike and ordered a set of <a href="http://www.hedcycling.com/wheels/ardennes.php">Hed Ardennes</a>. I completely understand the wider is better thing (from a riding stand point... and I'm beginning to think that the thinking behind super skinny tires is, in almost all cases, flawed. 

That said, I'm not a aerodynamics expert, nor is it clear that the science word has a really clear idea of all the forces in action as a bicycle tire, tube, wheel, and road interact. Rolling resistance is debated every which way, and the degree to which a given aero improvement has value in the real world... but all that, and all the marketing aside, I can tell you that wider feels better. It's not a large switch from 19 to 23mm wide, but the effect is noticable, and I really like how nicely they corner.

My disclaimer is that I recently started riding on a set of Salsa Gordo hoops, which are 35mm wide, and love them too. Some part of me is clearly and forever a fat tire guy.

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/winter-hills-with-jenni.png" alt="winter_hills_with_jenni.png" border="0" width="146" height="288" align="left">That said, the wheels (which are a slightly tougher "stallion" build (larger bearings, a few more spokes)) are still plenty light. They have a bit of a hollow hum from hubs, but it's musical and not annoying. The rear engagement mechanism is quiet and solid. The wider rim spreads the contact patch and shortens the sidewall a bit, but I didn't really notice much difference there with the following exceptions: The transition from straight up to tilted over is far smoother, and it feels like the tires are putting more rubber on the road when it's leaned over. The bearings and races are clearly of high quality, and the front wheel feels like it will spin forever. I didn't opt for the ceramic bearing option. Seems like a waste for most of us (or at least me). All in all, the wheels felt great. I'm very pleased.

The downside... the rims are wider! The Zero Gravity brakes I had no longer fit (they didn't open wide enough). Your mileage may vary, but mine didn't. So I sold them and replaced them with <a href="http://willyoumaketheleap.com/">SRAM Red brakes</a>. They're only about 50 grams heavier, open wider, and are plenty good enough for me. Also, should I decide to upgrade the Force group on the bike, it would be to Red. Annoying that the 0Gs don't open up enough, but not a big deal in the scheme of things, and certainly not a reason not to buy the Ardennes. For most folks, this clearly wouldn't even be a consideration.

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/noahs-never-far-behind.jpg" alt="noahs_never_far_behind.jpg" border="0" width="150" height="150" align="right" />

On today's ride Jenni was in a celebratory mood, which in her case apparently means hill climbing (Really? Crazy Girl(tm)). So that's what we did. We got a late start for us and so lights were the order of the day. I love riding as the sun sets for two reasons. One, it's the opposite of when I ride most often (daybreak). Two, it feels like I've been riding all day, yet I feel really fresh. Heh. The day had finally warmed up a bit although it never came near the 46F promised degrees. And of course, was getting colder rather than warmer. But I recently added a piece to my riding outfit straight from my closet... a very windproof soft shell thingy, and it has greatly improved my comfort level in the cold.

Before I left on the ride, I was getting things together with my bike and of course, since there were tools and things about, Noah was not far behind.

He helped me get the wheels on the bike, and attempt to adjust the brakes, which led to a quick trip to the bike store for parts. After changing wheels and tires around this week... the spare bedroom had that winter look to it. Trainers are out, wheels are everywhere... from the reverse angle you'd see the Jones bike having been reshod with knobbies... really looking forward to hitting some trails with that baby.

Anyway, bring on the steady state intervals...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've enjoyed the explosion of video resources on the net. People have yet another way to share moments from their lives, etc. etc. And along with that come life's little mishaps. And as almost everyone will admit, viewing a prat fall, a slip, a fall, or a splash can be funny. It's part sympathy, recognition that we all walk a tight rope with dignity on one side and humiliation on the other... and partially just the simple fun of watching others get in to trouble.

But I'm troubled by something as I watch some of these videos.

People face plant, bang their heads against rocks, launch themselves onto all manner of nasty surfaces and time and again the person taking the video (and you can tell when it's hand held and when it's not) does absolutely nothing besides watch. I was horrified when I saw one sampling from the Fail blog where a cyclist smacked their head against a rock with significant force and the person behind the camera did nothing besides ask the person (eventually) if he was alright.

Folks, two thoughts. If you witness an "unintentional result" in front of a camera... see if the person needs help rather than worry about "the shot". The second thought is, if you're going to do something in front of a camera know that Heisenberg understood that the camera was going to have an affect on the proceedings. For some reason, these effects seem to be almost universally negative for the person being observed for any "cusp" event.]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.speedgoat.com/blogB.asp?p=1719">Chinese Jones?</a>:According to a thread on the MTBR 29er forum, a company in China is knocking off Jeff Jones' Spaceframe. I haven't had a chance to talk to Jeff for months now, and I have no idea if he's yet seen these "Ti Special style MTB frames," but they're an interesting example of form leading function, the complete opposite of everything Jeff believes in.<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[How cheezy.

		<title>Merrell Thermo 6 Waterproof (recommended)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/thermo6waterproof.png" alt="thermo6waterproof.png" border="0" width="395" height="259" align="left" /> Everyone once in a while I run into a product (that is, I wasn't looking at the time) that turns out just great. <a href="http://www.merrell.com/US/Default.aspx#store/M/M-F/10414M-16747/">The Merrell Thermo 6 Waterproof
</a> is once such product.

It's been very snowy already and all my boots and shoes are getting wet and ruined. They're not meant for winter except for one pair, and I can't wear them all the time (like to work) because they're high, and lot of my pants don't fit over them, and they're not appropriate looking for work (that's a whole 'nother discussion).

I was returning a pair of gloves Noah picked out for my birthday (wrong size), and I saw the aforementioned boots. I saw that they were going to be waterproof, nice grippy looking soles, soft around the ankles, and insulated. Perfect! I tried a couple of sizes just to be certain, they're really comfortable and warm (for the conditions in which I intend to wear them.)

I was out in them today with a few inches of snow, some sledding with Noah, and some shoveling and car clearing, and they were everything I expected at 14 degrees F.

So if you need a nice, not too costly pair of 3 season water resistant boots (but not just a membrane thing, but a "plastic" boot) recommended.

First I was sick, and the weather has been uncooperative to say the least. I still don't need great weather, but the roads have been covered in ice and slush and salt, and the trails are too far away... so other than some turns around the backyard, and some hiking... feh.

Today was sunny, bright, and relatively warm (45 degrees give or take), so I grabbed a bike, found Jenni and went for a spin through the park. There were some sketchy parts, but mostly it was quite lovely, and overall it was a lovely spin. Big, fat, knobby tires were the order of the day and as a bonus they make you work pretty much all the time. The 165 cranks still feel little weird to me, but less so. I may try switching them out for slightly longer ones, but not just yet.

I wore some new cycling duds, a birthday gift from my wife... Jenni berates me into mentioning, and I also met the first day of "28 Days of Exercise" easily on this ride. Another first. I'm tweeting using #twentyeightdays, thinking about using #dailygoals as well (Since it can be <a href="http://trackdailygoals.com/users/danielberlinger">tracked</a> easily.

What does one call a collection of firsts? Suggestions welcome.]]></content:encoded>

Some of the folks at the office are distraught at the departure of Conan O'Brien and posted a large sign in the window that faces his office saying "Conan, Don't Go!" and above you can see the response... "I already bought the tickets." I understand he waved as well, although apparently, I'm once again not part of the in crowd and missed the event itself.

While I don't have a picture, one of my fellow devs posted a "F" in our window, which expressed his feelings about the entire thing without causing a corporate stir.

A few minutes out of the otherwise routine days we spend toiling away at our various tasks.

And while I'm mentioning my brushes with greatness, Little Stevie van Zandt of Springsteen and Sapranos fame picked up his Range Rover up from the lot where I park. While I'd never met him before, he was pleasant to anyone who walked over and said something to him. Nice.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/picture-2.png" alt="Picture 2.png" border="0" width="279" height="518" align="left" /> Rides have been few and far between. Busy at work (thank goodness!), uncooperative weekend weather, etc. But the clock changes marks the official start of ride season, and this was the inaugural ride of the club.

Now the problem with riding this weekend is that everyone is short on sleep. But this was going to be interesting because the weather was soooo cooperative. I mean 60+ degrees (F)? When it might snow in a couple of days? So 16 folks turned out (that's a lot for our little club).

I expected this ride to be interesting because you have folks who haven't looked at their bikes all winter, and probably put them away in need of repair or service. And certainly, there were going to be people who are deeply out of shape from a lack of winter biking.

And the ride did not disappoint. One person who is new to clipless pedals fell over in the parking lot. Others crawled up the one incline (I refuse to say hill). Someone else broke a spoke (and I watched as the reflector attached to said spoke was slowly beaten to death on the left seat stay. Normally I'd be surprised that it would take someone so long to pull over and stop considering the racket and destruction going on back there, but this person's drivetrain was making so much noise prior that I don't think he noticed. And of course, over all the pace was glacial. That's how these rides go though...

Of course, my own fitness needs a lot of work—I was soundly thrashed at each town line sprint I contested ("contested" just might be too strong a word). But I did climb that incline in the big ring with no trouble, which is the outcome of a lot of work too, so things are looking promising.

All in all, it was great to see everyone, nice to see so much enthusiasm on the roads (so many folks riding today), and a while I suspect it will be freezing for a while yet... today was brimming with hope and renewal, and the always fun spark that represents the beginning of yet another seasonal campaign in pursuit of health, fitness, and fun. Allez!]]></content:encoded>

Berst said other technologies that could be included might be technologies that shift the times that appliances use energy, so that — for instance — your water heater might start up before the morning peak and store hot water until you need it for your shower..."
<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Seven or eight years ago I worked with NYSERDA on a test of smart meters. We were learning whether folks would adjust their energy use if the the "non-socialized" rate for electricity. (When demand is high, the price is higher for the the utilities but they "even it out" to charge a flattened rate.) Anyway, some of the upside of all this is that assuming that utilities follow through on some of the stuff we tested (signaling price shifts so that it was easier to make decisions, or better yet, make smart controllers for devices that either run automatically when demand is low (pool pumps at night is a classic example) or at least warning you when you turn on your dishwasher that if you can wait, it'll be cheaper, etc. would be nice.

Further, smart meters require connectivity. It can be done in a drive by way as it is where population density is high (a truck drives triggering data dumps from the meters), but it would be better if they worked on increasing connectivity at the same time. Might provide some payback for people who just might wind up with higher utility bills.]</cite>]]></content:encoded>

I'm fond of "exploiting" the work of others to my benefit, and I love when folks simplify old gnarly issues. Anyway, every once in a while I write one of these posts to highlight some of the stuff I've been tinkering with in the lab. It acts a signpost for me, and reminds of projects often long gone by the time I look back. Some or all of these will appear in various projects at work or my own projects in the near future.

<a href="http://goodexperience.com/2009/03/where-are-the-true-be.php">Where are the true believers? - Good Experience</a>: Or should we invest $50 billion in a new electronic medical record? That's the proposal from the government, and I can't imagine it changing anything. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I know they won't for two reasons... and in this case I will stick to the computer tech of the situation. When I worked at a compnay that worked with hospitals, i saw first hand the mess that is many hospitals data infrastructure. I mean it's really truly horrible. Monolithic, badly engineered hacks rule the day. I can imagine how it got there... but I blame the administrators who obviously invested the bare minimum in their infrastructure and now have a huge morass out of which to climb. Second is at a more personal level. I have a fine primary care physician. I trust him, he pays attention, knows the family history, etc. Because of the business side of the doctoring business he joined the equivalent of a conglomerate, which naturally centers their IT cost. All good, except they have a EMR system and when it fails to connect to the database (I wasn't there as a tech, but as a patient) the system is worthless. No EKG or other tests. No access to records, no updates. Just a few simple paper pages to record new information that no doubt will have to be transcribed (with errors) by the staff. It's 2009 for criminies sake... what the hell is that? No local storage? No syncing of records? What a freakin mess. And this from a major player in health care in my area. "Sucks" doesn't begin to describe it...

BTW, as for the true believers... I think they're there. I'm just not sure there's enough of them where it matters.]</cite></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[You're all stats weenies! 24.33 miles, 693 feet of climbing.]</p>

<p>These are words that cannot be trusted. Ever. Jenni, seen here, is notoriously untrustworthy when it comes the words above. I've learned not to trust those words, they are simply never the case.<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/0531091025a.jpg" alt="0531091025a.jpg" border="0" width="250" height="187" align="left" /></p>

<p>That said, I figured at least there would be no hills that look like walls as many Rockland county hills can. The rest I was up for...</p>

<p>Now Jenni did have a plan to make us climb a significant bit of hill... but I knew I wasn't ready for that today and I had a time limit as well (more on that later).</p>

<p>We started at Bear Mountain State park. I got there early to spin a bit and warm up. It was cool when I started (50F) so I had knee warmers, a thin rain cape, and a hat under my helmet. Jenni of course, could not pass up a chance to poke fun, even as she screamed in pain on the first shady downhill, which no doubt froze various body parts that, well, probably should never freeze. It was easy enough to shed the jacket and hat, and eventually knee warmers as the day warmed. And the peasants rejoiced!</p>

<p>I digress however.</p>

<p>We rode across the Bear Mountain bridge which you can see here:<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/0531090955.jpg" alt="0531090955.jpg" border="0" width="250" height="187" align="right" /></p>
<p>Turning north, we headed up 9D toward Cold Spring. As you can see the scenery is quite lovely as you ride along the Hudson Highlands. You pass a bunch of historical markers including the spot where the "First Chain" was stretched across the Hudson to prevent the British ships from making their way up the river.</p>

<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/img_0111.jpg" alt="IMG_0111.jpg" border="0" width="360" height="270" align="left" /></p>

<p>There's one nice spot where you've descended to the river and you are essentially at the bottom and that's where we turned around. Jenni was captivated by the outcropping, dreaming dreams of climbing the face. I was wondering whether I could a hitch  ride back up the hills via a passing van or something.</p>

<p>Actually, they weren't bad at all, not steep, not long, and quite pleasant over all. Plus since I dropped my BP med the other day (courtesy of my new diet and old Doc) I felt far better than recently when my blood pressure was 80 something over 50 for a brief period.</p>

<p>I'm finally getting some consistent miles under my wheels, and with the recent drop in weight I'm beginning to feel good. I haven't crossed that threshold this year, ya know, the one where I feel like a cyclist, but the riding has been improving steadily, some fitness should follow now that a health impediment has been removed.</p>


<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/0531090858.jpg" alt="0531090858.jpg" border="0" width="250" height="187" align="right" /></p>

<p>As for the aforementioned time limit, Gerry Laybourne was kind enough to invite the old dev team from Oxygen to her home to catch up and once again enjoy each others company. So after the ride this morning I hustled home, we finished packing some food, and headed into the City to Central Park. Noah got a kick out of the horses and Pedicabs, and as excited as he was to visit the City and see everyone, he fell asleep in his stroller giving Lisa and I a few minutes to sit in the shade and enjoy each others company. Then we had a chance to catch up with everyone for a few hours. It was quite beautiful. Such a lovely group of people.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/climb_toward.png" alt="climb_toward.png" border="0" width="508" height="460" align="left" /> Yesterday's ride never had a hope of being flat. And it's time for me to get hilly. I need some fitness and the hills are one way to do it.

Lately, there's been a fairly consistent crowd for the Sunday morning rides, but they are clearly more fit than I. Little wonder considering the dearth of riding for me this year... but it does represent a challenge I'm up for. Anyway, a few weeks ago I had an abortive ride caused mostly by my being over-medicated in the blood pressure dept. following a significant change in diet. After 500ft of climbing I had to call it quits with my heart racing in my chest. No pain, but completely toast. I basically turned around after 5 miles, rolled back down the hill as far as I could, stopped to let my heart slow, and continuing. When I reached the bottom, after sitting still for fifteen minutes, I finally caught my breath and slowed my heart. Then, I rode some more, because while I was cooked, there was no pain, so I felt safe. The next day, with my Doctors consent I dropped the BP medication and haven't looked back. The <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2009/05/31/its-gonna-be-flat/">next ride</a> had the leeway that comes along with only riding with one other person, but began to suggest that things were getting better.

Of course, there was a two week layoff from riding again (I simply can't get my schedule together this year, yet. Maybe my boss can help me out...) so once again I had no idea how I was going to feel on a ride that I knew would have some steep climbing.

I started poorly as I left any hints of cash at home. I also forgot that the Park where we were starting starts collecting parking fees at 8. I was there two minutes after. Sigh. So I used an old trick that allows me to park free of cost, but does cause me to ride a short steep at the end of my ride in order to get to my car. 

So I roll out for a warmup loop, carefully timed so that I'm at the starting point nicely warmed up when I realize that I'm not wearing my sunglasses. It's not really a problem, but the glasses I had on are not nearly as protective, so I hustled up a bit and climbed back to the car, exchanged glasses and rolled back to the parking lot.

The climbing started shortly after we left. First good sign, I wasn't completely off the back. Second good sign, I was close enough to stay with the group for about 15 miles before I finally hit a patch of climbing that separated me from the pack. Finally, there was one other person who was in roughly the same boat (while climbing) although better than I still, but close enough that we formed a gruppeto and made our way back. We were sorely tempted to bail and have my wife deliver us back to the start since we were very close to my house at the time, but I was determined not to bail. That's a bad habit to get into.

In the end, we had a great ride back, and another frien we met in the parking lot was kind enough to toss my bike in his van and drive me up the last incline. I was cooked, but in a far better way. And while I climbed slowly, I never redlined or got to the point where I needed to stop. Good stuff. Now to continue to build on my dropping weight and increasing fitness.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Worn out gear (5.10 Camp Fours are the new hotness!)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/5-10campfours.jpg" alt="5.10campfours.jpg" border="0" width="375" height="236" align="left" /> Now that summer has arrived, despite the wet weather, I decided to go through the gear and chuck or giveaway the worn footwear and replace that which needed replacing.

Many of you will recognize the dislike of removing well broken in gear... stuff I've been happy with for years. At the same time, the companies move on and you sometimes can't replace stuff. However, sometimes, stuff works out.

I've been wearing <a href="http://www.fiveten.com/">Five Ten</a> shoes for a long time. It started way back when I was hiking and climbing. Their slippers were a standard amongst the crowd, and I very quickly fell in love with their Guide Tennies (the down to the toe lace adjustment, super sticky stealth rubber, and supportively stiff soles) and have worn them ever since (about 4 pairs worth at this point).

Naturally, looking to replace some light hikers I've had for a while, I turned to them and found their Camp Four model a mid ankle style that I like for hiking (not too high, not too low), a sole stiff where it needs to be, a nice fitting heel cup, and the down to the toe lacing. Some were suggesting a half size larger, but I found my regular size was best.

It's been a few days and I can assure you they're as good as one would hope. They're light, comfortable, have the right balance of cushion to stiffness. They'd make an excellent hiker even with a heavyish pack (although I'm from the "go light" school myself (Tuckerize that pack!)).

Anyway, If you've never tried Five Ten, give them a whirl, they have a nice range, are a family owned business, and produce some of the stickiest rubber for hiking and climbing. (The pair of Teva sandals that I use for river running has 5.10 stealth rubber on the bottoms... they are so much better than everything else I've tried on slick wet rocks.)

More gear stuff (which everyone seems to ask me about) as I have time.

Disclaimer: I have no relationship with Five Ten other than that of happy customer.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was finally sunny, and I got out for a nice loop. 1300 ft. of climbing, 32 miles and change.</p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/local_loop.png" alt="local_loop.png" border="0" width="467" height="501" align="left" /> <p>As a bonus I found a way to ride the significant hill into Harriman that leaves me on my bike. You see, I've been beating myself against a wall of hill that is insidious in its elevation. It starts at a 10 percent grade, but quickly eases to 8 or 9% and then again for a span to 7 or 8. But it's just a setup. Just when you think all is well it rises back to 9% and stays there for a while, and then if that hasn't gotten ya, rises back to 10 and then, once again, just when you think you're good -- it finishes with a section at 13%. Ow.</p>

<p>There's a road that joins just before the 13% grade but that road stair steps its way to that point. Plenty of time to catch one's breath, etc.<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/church_jenni_hoop.jpg" alt="church_jenni_hoop.jpg" border="0" width="120" height="160" align="right" />On the far side of the hill I took a side road (the benefits of having a GPS with me) and found this sign, which had been nicely modified.</p>

<p>A great day for a ride.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/jenni_and_i.png" alt="Jenni_and_I.png" border="0" width="345" height="252" align="right" />
 It was a glorious day to take Noah swimming. Lisa headed off to her parents place, leaving me time to ride and take care of some chores. After that we were going to prepare for the week, and watch the Tour.</p>

<p>I set off with Jenni, headed for my local loop with its climbs, swoopy descents, and dappled sunlight. Hold that thought.

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/john_mike_me.jpg" alt="John_mike_me.jpg" border="0" width="288" height="188" align="right" /></p>

<p>We ran into John and Mike out for their own lovely spin. The weather was truly spectacular. Ok. Back to Dappling.</p>

<p>The dappled sunlight will kill you on a decent. It hides all sorts of road issues... such as abyss like pot holes. I saw the monster at the last second, cleverly hiding in the shadows next to a bright patch of sunlight, but I failed to completely hop the crevasse. I ejected my <img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/3034_1.jpg" alt="3034_1.jpg" border="0" width="125" height="200" align="right" /><a href="http://ecom1.planetbike.com/3034_1.html">super bright stealth Planet Bike tail light</a> when my rear wheel hit the front lip, but there was no point in stopping as it shattered in the roadway. The entire light didn't fly off the mount as is so often the case, no, no. Here the light split itself wide open leaving the back in the mount. And while I didn't know it at that moment, I untrued my back wheel with the same hit. Ow.</p>

<p>We decided to take the longer way around, which included hopping off one's bike to cross a bridge that is closed to  car traffic and headed for route 17 (not a particularly pleasant road to ride on because of the speed of the car traffic. We managed however to stay out of trouble, even during the nasty transition where cars exit left to continue on into NJ, and we hold out lane to get back to stay in NY.</p>

<p>We stopped for some drinks, and as we got into the quieter sections I heard the dreaded rhythmic rubbing sound. Next chance I got I hopped off my bike, spun the rear wheel, grimaced when I saw the deflection of the the untrue wheel, opened the rear brakes and pushed them off center. I hopped back on and continued.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="http://epicmoonflower.wordpress.com/2009/07/05/is-my-brake-rubbing-or-am-i-about-to-die/">Jenni</a> tells the story of her bonk. I don't tell other people's bonk stories, because, well, each of those folks has crawled along with me and my bonks, with nary a complaint or mention ever. That said, I've never seem Jenni bonk like she did yesterday. Not even close.</p>

<p>After I got home and cleaned up I realized I had one more chore to add to the list since I now had to get my rear wheel trued (and frankly inspected) on top of the other stuff. The key chore however was gassing up the Grill tank and buying the parts I needed to rebuild it. Somewhat organized, I made my way, got the parts I needed, my wheel and heart were true again and while batting the last of the yellow jackets out of my way rebuilt the grill in time to pile some "snausages" on there (Snausages being my borrowed term for the all veggie tofu "sausages" we've been eating as an occasional treat).</p>

<p>Very soon after Lisa and sleeping Noah returned from their day of splashing and fun. Noah woke up briefly, demanded a movie (since no one could manage to get the DVD player at his grandparents to work) and promptly fell back to sleep. Lisa and I enjoyed a quiet meal, and preparations for the week ensued. We fell asleep watching a fairly boring bit of Tour. Noah was up by 4:30am, ready to start his day. Me? Not so much. Allez!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I received an email from Rudolf Ammann about a <a href="http://tawawa.org/ark/p/jorn-barger-community.html">conference paper</a> that included a reference to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000609064357/http://news.circumtech.com/">an old website of mine</a> then five years into its existence. What a fun time period! (The paper was presented at <a href="http://www.ht2009.org/">Hypertext 2009</a>, 30 June 2009, Torino, Italy)

I'm cited as a source that the "NewsPage Network" wasn't yet "blog rolling" to use a term that couldn't possibly have existed at that moment. I can't say I thought of folks who used that software as a network, although I see why one could.

<blockquote>Several years into his news page project, Daniel Berlinger for his part had yet to put up any sort of links to kindred sites.<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000609064357/http://news.circumtech.com/">[30]</a> Thus, the sites that Gulker identified as a network shared a publishing tool and a publishing model but no sense of cohesion amongst each other.</blockquote> (The actual citation is "Berlinger, Daniel (2000-06-06). "News from the Digital Prairie". Circumtech. Retrieved on 2009-06-30.")

I think that's a fair statement.

But at roughly the same time there's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001003154440/archipelago.phrasewise.com/2000/05/23">another site</a> of mine that has pointers to a network of folks, although in a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040718105109/archipelago.phrasewise.com/2000/06/06">redesign</a> not long after, they're gone again.

And I think looking back (with all the problems and corrections and misremembering of this sort of thing) that I was writing many sites that were constantly being organized and reorganized with different themes and ideas. The Archipelago site was  a eat your own dog food site for my weblog editor (named, appropriately, Archipelago). Then as FAQs rolled in and development continued the site was redesigned with new focus and features. The header image for example changed with the seasons, and eventually was automated to do so. Other sites were more about longer form writing, rather than linking to news of the day. But anyway...

Nicely done.

And a toast to all the folks who quietly brought the idea of writing on the web to life, one little bit at a time.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.technewsworld.com/rsstory/67502.html?wlc=1246925440&amp;wlc=1247140396">"Those direct, near-instantaneous dispatches are far less reliable than old-fashioned journalism."</a> And upon this I call BS. I have found that any reportage where I've been to the event, seen and heard and experienced for myself, has been incorrect at some level of detail. Every single one. Why? Because of editing. Because if you're collecting interviews and making notes you are not experiencing the event. Because certain interests are promoted (newsworthiness, sponsorship, patronage etc.)</p>

<p>I don't disagree that the wildfire repetition of unconfirmed information is the road to accuracy either. But this core assumption that the news orgs are more reliable than a series of first hand accounts is just crap.</p>

<p>Also in this article is whining from Steve Frothingham:</p>

<blockquote>It's one-sided," said VeloNews.com editor Steve Frothingham in explaining the policy. "It's us just sitting there taking what he's giving. We can't just not ask follow-up questions, we can't ask any questions.</blockquote>

<p>Have you heard the inane, worthless, follow up questions most reporters ask? I'm not saying that it's easy in the scrum that is most press events to come up with scintillating and to the point questions, but considering that and the usual lack of answer (stay on message, stay on message) it's hardly problematic.</p>

<p>What all this whining is really about is disintermediation. And that's a problem not so easily fixed if your in the news business.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it's been kinda rough (it's all relative, but ya know.) Work has been a challenge, it's still rainy on the weekends, and Lisa has been going through some health stuff... and some great folks have passed away recently.</p>

<p>A couple guys were let go at work. And it's never easy, and they were good guys. To clear the air we arranged our team room more to our liking. It helped clear the air, set a new spirit, brought some of the lightness that comes with cleaning and clutter removal. But it wasn't quite enough.</p>

<p>We got a chance to work with someone new on some of our stuff this week. Matt has been really cool to work with, we've got the start of some excellent improvements. Living as he does way closer to Philly than I, he was able to procure some excellent beer which is hard to get up here.</p>

<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/dogfish_head_box.png" alt="dogfish_head_box.png" border="0" width="432" height="324" align="center" /></p>

<p>Some friends had long ago recommended <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/">Dogfish Head Craft Brewed Ales</a>, but it was not easy to get the varieties around here, and I had only tried one. But it lent enormous promise to this undertaking.</p>

<p>Matt understands the awesome power of beer, and in true braveheart, knight of the realm, heck or high water fashion, dragged six packs and four packs of Raison D'Etre, Indian Brown Ale, Pano Santo Marron and 90 Minute Imperial IPA (all from Dogfish Head) up from down there to us here in the Big City. Considering it's like a 3 hour train ride and haul across town... it was much appreciated.</p>

<p>We made some room in a little known fridge for six bottles and got to work. At the end of the day, with one last meeting to go, we broke out the varieties for some tasting to go with the meeting. Now anyone who has cracked a cold one when a group has been working hard and fighting the good fight knows the positive impact a good beer can have... this wasn't a loud, chugging keg thing... it was a tasting, an exploration, a gentile experiment in the possibilities and hard work of others... a small bit of sensory payback for a hard working team enjoying the work of other hard working folks (beer this good cannot be easy to make!)</p>

<p>And the Dogfish Head did not disappoint. Mark had this to say about the Palo Santo Marron "I love the caramel flavor! One of the best brown ales I've ever had." Evan said "If I had to assign a number between 1-10 the Raison D'Etre would get an 11" (and I'd agree, I loved it! Lively and filled with flavor, beautifully balanced, with a rich earthy color).</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, there was a lot of "Hi, c'mon on in, the meeting will be over in a few minutes, grab a glass and have a taste (pause for pouring, sniffing, tasting... ah and then...) "You guys sure know how to live!". Which is is exactly why the effort was made to procure Dogfish Head. The team deserved to feel that level of care and appreciation. Done.</p>

<p>Dogfish Head... simply amazing. (If you're reading along here, make the effort to try some.) It's a shame they don't sell sampling packs...</p>

<p>We'll be doing this every two weeks, suggestions about highest quality craft beers are welcome...</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<p>I've tried really hard to get past the <a href="http://www.fatcyclist.com/2009/08/11/the-funeral-and-whats-next/">passing of Susan last week</a>. I've never met her, I only passed a couple of emails to <a href="http://www.fatcyclist.com/">Elden</a> here and there. But the ride a week from this Sunday (<a href="http://philly09.livestrong.org/daniel">Strength is forever. Fight Like Susan.</a> for which I'm still raising money) has kept her in my mind far more than I would have thought. Dug, a friend of the Nelson's <a href="http://suncrestdug.wordpress.com/2009/08/11/ill-try-to-make-room-for-you">wrote this a couple of days back</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>As part of the rambling, Sue casually mentioned how tired she was, and how nice it would be if she could just climb up into the bed with Susan and they could cuddle and rest and just “be.”</p>

<p>And to her surprise, Susan fluttered open her eyes, painfully reached over to the bed guard (when the act of rolling over was fraught with danger of broken bones), struggling to open it, and weakly whispered “I’ll try to make room for you.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Dug asks a good question there at the end. I couldn't help thinking that the action implied by that phrase can change the world. If we all just made room for each other, our differing beliefs, ideas, and thoughts... If we all just scrunched over a bit to accomodate the next person... simply because. How can it not be the right thing to do, to give a little of whatever you have? Even if it might hurt. The world can be a far better place. Susan gave us a glimpse.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First the good stuff. Elden is incredibly gracious and warm. He clearly gets a heartfelt joy out of seeing so many people wearing FatCyclist jerseys, bibs, and stuff. And he made everyone feel like they were part of a family and equally clearly, everyone there embraced the Nelson family as inspiration for the fundraising, and felt the pain of the recent loss of Susan—amazing considering most of us never came close to meeting her in person. There were also so many amazing stories... and fortunately the ride was long enough to hear some of them. Congrats to Elden and the entire Nelson family, to Philly Jen, LizzyLou, Jenni, Rita, Gene, Jamieson, and all the folks I met on the road, if only as "Hey Fattie! Nice job!". Now on with my story.</p>

<p>[Executive summary: I was up all night driving down to Philly, I changed, rode my bike 60 miles over a bunch of short steep hills, got back in my car and drove home. So about 6 hours of driving, 5 hours of biking, two hours standing around in the start area talking to "Fatties". Details below.]</p>

<p>It was Saturday night Aug 22nd. Lisa and Noah had just left for a trip to her parents and to visit some old friends of hers. The house was unusually quiet. I spent a few minutes gathering my thoughts, and then I started gathering clothes, shoes, food, and tools. Bike trips always seem to include a lot of paraphernalia.</p>

<p>I hadn't been to a Livestrong Challenge before, if all goes well and I go back next year, I'll know that they do an excellent job, with plenty of human and bike support. I can pack far lighter.</p>

<p>Since I was not entirely sure of all the variations of my plans, I grabbed a sleeping bag, and mini blanket that stuffs into a pillow. I also loaded up two chairs (in case I had company) and some beach towels to preserve my sense of dignity and frankly, everyone else's since I suspected I'd be changing near my car.</p>

<p>Well prepped, I took a few moments to again consider all the people involved. Susan Nelson, who recently passed away, the "raison d'être" of Team Fatty, my friend Wendy who recently learned of her illness... and all the others who had their lives derailed by cancer attacking their family or friends. I shrugged away the sadness and rested for a while and then at 12:30am it was time to hit the road.</p>

<p>The drive down was estimated at 2.5 hours, and I assumed no traffic at this late hour, but didn't mind getting started. I could take my time, and still have plenty of extra for those "the map/gps says it's here, but it's not" moments that always occur in the last 10 miles of a road trip. And things went apace. The hotel where I was meeting my friends had an address of blah, where my gps had "east blah" and "west blah". And when I got to the spot the gps pointed, there was nothing even remotely hotel like. No worries, it was only around 3am, I still had an hour and half to meet my friend and pick up my registration stuff.</p>

<p>I punched in the event start and drove the few miles over there. I scoped out the ride and decided that I did not want to ride to the hotel just to turn around and ride back. The parking deal at the College was cool, and going there gave me some comfort that I would be able to find the hotel since I had looked up the route from the event to the hotel earlier and it felt like the right distance. Having found a nice place to park later, I turned around and left in search of the hotel. I tried the other "blah" this time, and it looked more promising, but still nothing. What should have been the next building over had a security guard, so inquired within. He gave me simple directions (Make a U-turn straight away, then 3 lefts starting at the light at the corner) into a corporate park and right to the hotel. Sheesh.</p>

<p>I walked inside (still way early) figuring a bathroom stop would be in order... but I couldn't accomplish all I wanted since there were only urinals in that men's room. Being sleep addled it didn't occur to me to use the woman's room. Ah well. I went back to the car since the lobby was freezing, grabbed my pillow, pushed the seat back and cat napped for about fifteen minutes before my phone went off to remind me to walk back inside to meet Jenni and pick up my stuff.</p>

<p>About 4:20am the event staff started coming down to get over to the site and get moving, aid stations, med folks, and all the other staff. Amazingly there wasn't the usual grumpiness of folks getting up that early. Nice. A couple even had the energy to ask me about my team and ride.</p>

<p>Having collected my stuff from Jenni and schmoozed for a few minutes, I got back in the car to drive back to the venue. This time I figured I could get a real nap in... but by the time I got there (around 5:10am) folks were pulling in, and I changed my plans. I was going to try a much smaller lot, in the hopes of finding a more deserted corner. And it was more deserted for about ten minutes when I realized that this was right next to the staging area for the rest stop supply trucks—now a beehive of activity. Sigh.</p>

<p>I decided to use the cover of darkness for my changing routine, and got into my cycling clothes with the help of the towels and chair in a few moments of quiet between truck dispatches. That done I estimated that it was time to eat some pre ride food. (While it is not artful, this should be considered foreshadowing). I ate and drank stuff I've had many times before without trouble. I don't believe I ate quickly, and do believe I washed it down with quite a bit of water. Everything seemed fine. It was later than I thought by the time all this unpacking, dressing, repacking, etc was done. So giving up on the nap, I hopped on my bike to ride around for bit and stretch my legs.</p>

<p>A couple of laps around the event area and a crowd was beginning to form like storm clouds on a sunny afternoon. I saw a couple Team Fatty jerseys and stopped to chat. It was nice to get to know some of the other folks on the team, and since I had no opportunity to participate in the other team events, this was going to be the only chance except random meetings during the ride. Little did I know how long we were going to be waiting there. The ride was supposed to start at 7 but didn't, in the end, get started until around 8. That was lot of standing around. And a lot of time to meet people.</p>

<p>Philly Jen and Elden had a few words for the gathering team, some prizes were awarded. People took a moment to say hello to Elden and have pictures taken with him, and have him sign their jerseys. He's amazingly gracious through all of this in a very unassuming way. He treated everyone like family. (That's family you actually like...)</p>

<p>After cheering our way through the usual pre ride stuff. It was finally time to start. Elden warned that he was going out fast, but that he'd be stopping at the first rest stop for anyone who wanted to say hi, pictures, etc...assuming he didn't keep going (which he did). After that he was going to cruise. Jenni, Jamieson, and I were up at the very front, which I felt was far safer than in the pack for this start. Plus we ganked into a lot of pictures, including the NBC news story. And before you knew it we were cranking. Of course, for me, any warming up I did was long gone, and worse, I felt a stitch form on my right side in an instant. "Gee, that's new" I thought. And not at all welcome. But I thought it would pass before too long, we weren't riding that fast. And it did... about 45 minutes later. I'd know more exactly except clearly in a related aspect I started to feel some gastric distress... and not the kind that a porta potty visit would remedy, but the kind that says, until I finish digesting whatever this is, it's gonna hurt. And so the distress and the stitch vied for attention. Lovely way to start a 100 mile ride.</p>

<p>I noticed that my ride buddies were not next to me or even just behind, so I sat up letting the first group go, since that was clearly getting me nowhere. It was cool to ride at the very front, seeing the cops close the roads ahead, and there was one quick look over my shoulder to see an endless stream of riders behind me (the event had over 6000 registered riders and runners). A brief conversation with Jenni (who was also not feeling well) and I found a pace that felt as comfortable as possible given how I felt.</p>

<p>The next tribulation was a brief little steep hill where my front derailleur refused to drop out of the big ring. I tried a few times, but it was not going, and I was at that moment in the middle of pack as the hill was hidden by a corner. There was tendency to bunch up as folks slowed on the hill and folks coming around the corner didn't know there was one. Stopping seemed like a terrible option... so I hauled with all my might on a gear combo completely unsuited to the steep little hill. I finally get enough power in there to slack off and get the rear gears changed and then after cresting, got the chain to drop to the small ring. I feel very lucky that my shoes stay clipped in, and that the shoes stayed on my feet, and that I didn't perform a face plant when either of the above could have come undone. I'd have been crushed! I would. </p>

<p>I've never hauled so hard to help get the cranks over the top. One genius called out "wrong gear combo" as he passed me. "Thanks, I must have missed the meeting where they said 50x13 is wrong for climbing 12% grades." thought I. Funny, I actually think he meant well. All I said was "It's stuck." between grunts.</p>

<p>About 9 miles in was the first rest stop, and after the usual stuff I rested and waited a few minutes for Jenni to show. After the initial frenzy and some more schmoozing with staff and volunteers we headed out... and so the day went. Stops were 9 - 13 miles apart. Serious climbs seemed to start just after a rest stop... so while I was freshened, I always seemed to be hauling two full bottles up the hills. Knowing that I just left a stop on this rapidly warming day I didn't jettison any water. Not helpful.</p>

<p>The ride was a lot of fun since there were a lot of Team Fatty folks. Unfortunately, I couldn't seem to find a group to ride with for more than a few miles. Either I fell off the back when we hit a hill, or I was way faster on the flats or downhills. The upside of this was that I got to "meet" quite a few "Fatties". A bonus surprise was that Elden, the Fatty In Chief, came up behind me at the crest of an incline saying hi to all the Team members as he rode. I didn't think anything of these latest "Hey Fatty, Team Fatty" calls since this had been going on all day... but when I turned to my left it was Elden with a fist bump awaiting a response. "Hi" I said in a surprised tone, since I never expected he was behind me somewhere. Since the road had just leveled, I sat in with the group of strong riders who were with him and rolled for while with the bunch. Of course, the road eventually turned upward again, and I was quickly dropped. I rode with Fatty in the Challenge. Cool.</p>

<p>Risky as it was, I managed the gastric distress by not eating. Not a good plan overall, and my energy was failing fast. Boo. But the stitch in my side had passed a while back. Yay. But my right sock had been torturing my right pinky toe, and were too thin to pad the ball of my foot. Boo. The next rest stop I took a chance, found some Kirkland brand trail mix and had a couple of shot cups full. No pain and some energy. I was offered some Poweraid by a bystander, almost icy cold. Ride magic. Nice! That helped a bit too.</p>

<p>I had decided not to attempt the century feeling like I did and took the 70 mile cutoff. I was beginning to wonder how many more hills I had in me. They were short, steep and repetitive. It was hot, and getting hotter. I hadn't eaten very much at all. Jenni decided to pull off at 50. I thought I could finish the 70. But ten miles later I was baking in the sun in the black team jersey (the ride was not as shady in the first/last ten miles as it was elsewhere), the pavement was sending waves of humid heat up at me. I was spent. 3155 feet of climbing, 60 miles, and a bunch of pointless ups and downs left to go. Decision made. I saw a shady tree and some folks up the road just a bit giving out ice cold water. This was the spot for me. One of the event bike riders stopped by a few moments later to make sure I was not in need of "real" help as I lounged in the shade of the tree. He offered to roll up the road to the folks giving out water and fill a bottle for me. I still had water, and would've done the same for myself in a bit, but he was so kind and desiring to help that I said "sure" and passed him a bottle. I was able to pay that forward immediately as there were now two other riders stopped under the little shade tree. I passed the bottle around, for all to enjoy. I called Jenni and asked if she was still in the area. And of course, she was willing to come back and get me.</p>

<p>And that was that. I did sheepishly roll down the finish line because it was shortest route back to my car. I know a lot of "SAGed" folks did that. It's not a race. And I could accept the cheers of the folks waiting there with a certain sense of accomplishment and grace. I raised some money to help the fight, I had ridden over 60 miles, and I had given it what I had after a long night's drive. Naturally, Elden was at the finish to greet as many Team Fatty folks as possible, and I understand he was there until everyone was off the course. I then walked just far enough (they asked folks to walk) to get back on my bike and roll to the car. I struggled to change into some compression tights (chair, towels, and sweaty legs all don't help. I'd hope that the compression would keep my legs from getting sore on the long trip home—either this worked like a charm or the heat made me feel worse on the bike than I should have.)</p>

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/front-at-start-line.png" alt="front at start line.png" border="0" width="258" height="195" align="right" />

<p>In the car I had plenty of fluids in the cooler and some munchies. Only a bit of congestion traffic on one section of 276. A slightly longer than the trip down, I was home 3 hours later. The shower felt awesome, as did the vegetable sushi I had waiting for me. I dozed off waiting for Lisa and Noah to get home, and was awoken with the happiest of sounds "Daddy, Daddy... are you done with your bike ride?".</p>

<p>So for all the folks who've inspired me, Susan, Elden, Wendy, Steve, my father-in-law Irwin Wolfson, a cancer survivor, all the folks who contributed, who rode with me. Thanks. Fight like Susan!</p>

<p>[Things I learned: Be even more careful about eating after staying up and driving all night. Watch out for bad sock choices (not enough padding underfoot and a seam that rubbed my small toe the wrong way). And how about some training? Yeah, that would be nice. Also, carry far less stuff. I probably could've carried at least a pound less between food I didn't eat, large water bottles I didn't all the capacity of, etc.]</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Daniel. Next time you must fess up or I'll beat you to death with a rusty chain.

We now have goals for next year- something to look forward too, yay!

I agree, I carried too much stuff.  In any other event, I like to be self-sufficient, but in all honesty, this event was so extraordinarily well staffed, I could've lost the weight of the stuff in my annoyingly big (yet surprisingly lighter than the smaller black) seat bag. 
So, yes, less stuff next time and oh yeah, smaller engine. I could go with smaller water bottles too since it was so very close between stops. 

And I have way more vertical feet than you- about 4100. Why come?

I'm glad we did this ride "together". Next year, let's train harder and smarter and have many fewer reasons for being there.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I didn't *not* tell you. It just wasn't a day where I could join in our usual ride whine fest. Too many people in my mind facing serious health issues. I'll try and be more aware next time. Sorry.

I dunno why such a difference in the vertical ft. Their map says 2700 or so. Who knows... one person;s blog reported the same ride as 5000+ ft. (I can't imagine).

"I’m glad we did this ride “together”. Next year, let’s train harder and smarter and have many fewer reasons for being there."

Maybe next year we'll both have time to train. And I look forward to Wendy joining us to celebrate the end of her treatments.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.rapha.cc/"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/uk_181_1_3-220-220.jpg" alt="UK_181_1_3--220-220.jpg" border="0" width="220" height="220" align="right" /></a>I can feel the cool weather returning, and my bike rides getting cold (I generally have to ride early.) The Lightweight Softshell pictured here (which may not be continuing in the line) is a perfect complement piece for these midway days. It's light and folds down to nothing, yet it's rain resistant and wind blocking and nice enough to wear off the bike. I recommend purchasing Rapha out of season as the prices reflect the quality, but by all means... do get some into your bike kit. It's wonderful stuff. Unfortunately for me lovely gear bought for me last year will be somewhat large on me this year. So it goes.</p>

<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/img_1170_small.jpg" alt="img_1170_small.jpg" border="0" width="225" height="139" align="left" />A friend at work noticed my shoes the other day... I promised a link. My well worn (and much beloved) <a href="http://www.fiveten.com/">5.10 Guide Tennies</a>. The Stealth rubber is awesome outside, but be careful inside, you can easily leave scuffs (which you can remove eraser like, but still. Super adjustable, with just the right amount of stiffness in the sole. An approach shoe, it's an excellent all arounder and joy whether doing some hiking, a bit of climbing, or just hanging around. Of course, it well suited to those common occasions when you're doing all of those, and I'd add an excellent shoe for "casual" biking as the sole has some stiffness to it which makes comfortable for pedaling with good energy transfer. I wore out the previous pair in just such a fashion but their demise was the result of my stubbornly riding my commute in the rain, and getting covered in liquified goose crap. Everything else (bike included) washed up nicely. The shoes were going to reek forever. So it goes.</p>

<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/img_0158.jpg" alt="IMG_0158.JPG" border="0" width="200" height="150" align="left" />Next up is the continuing tastings at work. We trying craft beers, and having a minor blast doing it. This is round two we're looking at. The <a href="http://www.bluepointbrewing.com/">Blue Point Blueberry Ale</a> was the one everyone loved that days. Kudos also went to the Troeg Troegenator on that day. A follow up tasting brought enjoyment from the Southampton IPA. For me, We didn't have the sort of food that compliment the Hop Rod Rye... it might have gotten a raw deal. Next tasting in a week. So it goes. 
</p>

<p>Next up date is tea. <a href=""><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/img_0171.jpg" alt="IMG_0171.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="240" align="right" /></a> Green tea specifically. This is part of the "vanquish the last vice" effort. I try and find what I think is the habit or vice that is most destructive to me and remove the most destructive portion. In my case that would seem to be the copious quantities of Diet Coke I drink at work. I've replaced that with drinking green tea. <a href="www.adagio.com">Adagio.com</a> makes this simple with their IngenuiTEA pot. A simple strainer mechanism makes it super easy to get hot water and leaves in and tea out in about 3 minutes. A 4 cup sized device means there's not really enough for our group. So it goes. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.tazachocolate.com/"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/img_0173.jpg" alt="IMG_0173.jpg" border="0" width="240" height="320" align="left" /></a>The last of today's updates was some artisanal hand made, fair trade, you got love people who care this much Chocolate (that's correct capital "C" in this case) from <a href="http://www.tazachocolate.com/">Taza</a>. The team was celebrating yet another launch, and so as is our way, a bit of chocolate is handed out to celebrate the achievement. In this case the Guajillo Chili, Cinnamon, Vanilla, and Cacao Puro varieties were loved in that order. Folks loved the crunchy nature of the chocolate (it's stone ground so bits of sugar and cocoa nibs remain). The Cacao Puro probably didn't get a fair shake since it came last, and had to compete with others. The Vanilla was considered a bit too subtle. So it goes. <img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/img_0169.jpg" alt="IMG_0169.jpg" border="0" width="160" height="150" align="right" /></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/screen-shot-2009-09-04-at-3-05-58-pm.png" alt="Screen shot 2009-09-04 at 3.05.58 PM.png" border="0" width="195" height="556" align="right" />Where was I? Oh yeah. Right. Got it. Vacation. We've been having a nice time despite work intrusions, worry about my sister's ongoing digestive issues etc. Yesterday I decided it was high time I got back on my bike and spun out the kinks after taking a week and half off. I hadn't seen the Lakeside crew in quite some time... in fact, I had no recollection of having done even a single loop around the Lake all year, but it turns out I had, as a part of a much longer ride.I thought I'd catch up and take it easy...</p>

<p>It was one of the more disorderly rides because of the size of the group, mechanical problems, and the widely varying levels. Lots of fun, but I wound up chasing and recovering rather the equivalent of strolling calmly. My knees let me know it today.</p>

<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/photo_2.jpg" alt="photo_2.jpg" border="0" width="115" height="121" align="left" />I did a quick 23 miler with Jenni today because time is always short on a Friday. It's one her favorite loops—from Suffern to Ridegwood and back. I forgot to take an NSAID  when the ride started and so had a bit of pain from cranky knees, but nothing to I couldn't handle. I climbed a bit slower on one section than I would have preferred, but the climbing was less painful than some of the steady state stuff. Should be all healed by the next ride. Temps were nice (which means I started out cool), sun and laughter were abundant, and a few glimpses of a nearing autumn.</p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/img_1393.jpg" alt="IMG_1393.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="179" /></div>

<p>Soon, my commute into the City will beckon, but for now it's all about the waining days of Summer, spending time with Lisa and Noah, embracing the very finest life has to offer. I'm also trying to work with my favorite companies on some fundraising ideas for next year. So far, no one has even responded. I'm hoping that they too are enjoying the end of summer...</p>

<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/img_1285.jpg" alt="IMG_1285.JPG" border="0" width="144" height="181" align="left" /><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/img_1264.jpg" alt="IMG_1264.JPG" border="0" width="288" height="213" align="right" /></p>

<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/img_1367.jpg" alt="IMG_1367.JPG" border="0" width="274" height="202" align="left" /></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>...but it's far cooler than it was a few weeks ago in the morning. 6:30AM this morning I tossed on a vest and  arm warmers and through a leg over my bike.</p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/localloop.png" alt="localloop.png" border="0" width="288" height="279" /></div><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/localloopscale.png" alt="localloopscale.png" border="0" width="288" height="89" /></div>

<p>Since the ride I did a few weeks ago I haven't been able to spin out all the pain in my knees, but both were better this week than last... and again I forgot to take some pre-ride NSAIDs. Sigh.</p>

<p>Anyway, I shouldn't have sneered at the cold this morning when I decided not to put on some leg warmers as well, there were some times that my knees were red with cold... not a good choice considering. Ah well. But on days like this I love riding early when the roads are quiet, the sun lights up the undergrowth, and the day is cool. Soon enough, it'll be truly cold when I ride, and I'll be whining (to myself if only) about being cold. As a final insult, some embrocation I've been waiting to try seems to have lost it's kick, and I didn't have time to rinse off and use something else. Life, in the small sense, can be... unkempt.</p>

<p>So 28 miles later, I cleanup and hit the road (in the car this time) with the Little One and the Wife. I had pulled out a shirt with happy little football on it, and hoped that I might get a chance to watch a little bit of opening day Jets or Giants.  (Both teams won!) We visited a favorite craft fair and said hello to some of the artists and artisans we see year after year (they do become like family after a while... you know the good family that you miss hanging with and don't see often enough). The Wife picked up a inexpensive bauble or two, and then on our way to check out the "tent sale" of another favorite store, we ran into a street fair where the Little One got a chance to climb into a fire truck for a photo-op. Moments later, the two of them were contemplating a classic street rod. Ah... the joys of youth. And in this fashion the last Sunday I'll be able to enjoy for a while was spent.

<a href="http://harmonyandliberty.com/blog/?p=45#comments">Accelerating Future » 10 Futuristic Materials</a>: <p>1.  <strong>Aerogel</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src='http://harmonyandliberty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/supercriticality.jpg' alt='Aerogel' /></p>
<p></strong>Aerogel holds 15 entries in the Guinness Book of Records, more than any other material. Sometimes called “frozen smoke”, aerogel is made by the supercritical drying of liquid gels of alumina, chromia, tin oxide, or carbon. It’s 99.8% empty space, which makes it look semi-transparent. Aerogel is a fantastic insulator — if you had a shield of aerogel, you could easily defend yourself from a flamethrower. It stops cold, it stops heat. You could build a warm dome on the Moon. Aerogels have unbelievable surface area in their internal fractal structures — cubes of aerogel just an inch on a side may have an internal surface area equivalent to a football field. Despite its low density, aerogel has been looked into as a component of military armor because of its insulating properties.</p>

<p>Not long ago, my friend <a href="http://evanclosson.com/">Evan</a> decided I (and the team) needed to taste some <a href="http://www.bluepointbrewing.com/">Bluepoint Blueberry</a>. Of course, he brought other varieties when the time came (we try and taste four varieties in order to get some sense of the brewery as a whole and not just a single flavor or batch) he brought a growler of Oatmeal Stout. I do enjoy a stout. Seemingly almost any stout.</p>

<p><strong>This</strong> one however was particularly smooth and rich. Seriously. No... seriously! Sure it was helped by the lack of preservatives that bottled beer contains, but even so, this was wonderfully balanced.</p>

<p>There was a bit leftover when all was said and done, so I cooked it down with some roasted onions and placed it on a number of different vegetable sandwiches. This classic recipe for brats works really well for all sorts of things, I find if you;re not using it with a meet product that sour things and spicey things help to balance the sweetness of the onions and stout. So an eggplant wrap with chipotle,  tomato, and the onions is awesome. You can also add some Tahina to the onions to further thicken, and balance some bitterness against the sweetness. (and blend if you're using it as a dressing or spread). The Bluepoint Oatmeal Stout worked exceptionally well for all these cases as well.</p>

<p>In a couple of weeks we'll be using a similar recipe, but we'll be cooking outside over hickory and oak. You <strong>can</strong> in fact smell the yumminess.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/sets/72157622362858775/"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/3969146952_6031fd6ca3_m.jpg" alt="early morning commute photo" border="0" width="240" height="180" align="right" /></a>
<p>For years I've been <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/sets/72157622362858775/">documenting my commutes</a>, usually around the change of seasons. Today it once again struck me to take some snaps, but since I hadn't given it a moments thought all I had was a phone. Still, as the saying goes, the best camera is the one you have with you...</p>

<p>The drive starts in darkness this time of year, the sun rises as I go, and the day has begun when I get into the City. I do not recommend taking pictures while driving... but I've developed quite a few techniques for making this work, which I will <strong>not</strong> discuss.</p>

<p>And now the continuation of the Houndstooth Chronicles&trade;. Here is a scarf I found for seven dollars that continues the journey. Casually wrapped around my neck this morning, it's a great transition piece, keeping the drafts out in the cool mornings, yet easily adjusted and removed.</p>

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/img_0278.jpg" alt="IMG_0278.jpg" border="0" width="528" height="207" align="left" />

<p>For reference, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houndstooth">Wikipedia</a> defines houndstooth thusly: "Houndstooth checks originated in woven wool cloth of the Scottish Lowlands, but are now used in many other materials. The traditional houndstooth check is made with alternating bands of four dark and four light threads in both warp and weft woven in a simple 2:2 twill, two over - two under the warp, advancing one thread each pass."</p>

<p>I don't see the hound in all this, but I do love the constraint of the pattern applied in so many different ways. It is that tension that makes design so exciting to me. Another favorite? Herringbone. We'll be getting to that soon...</p>

<p>Lastly, a shout out to the guys at <a href="http://outlier.cc/">Outlier</a>. I've been meaning to write something about their designs which I've been wearing for a while now, both on and off the bike. A full write up of the pieces I've worn soon... <a href="http://outlier.cc/"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/photo_21.jpg" alt="Photo_2.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="299" /></div></a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Too many questions yesterday... so for those who asked questions better asked of the interwebs and someone who knows something...I filched expertise from <strong>Turnbull &amp; Asser</strong>:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Warp and Weft</strong>: All weaves are made up from Warp and Weft ‘yarns’. Warp ‘yarns’ run along the length of the material, whilst weft ‘yarns’ run across the width of the material. It is the different methods of interlacing the warp and weft ‘yarns’ that create a particular type of weave. Many of the most common weaves have acquired names that come down to us over the centuries.</p>

<p>Brief Glossary of Weaving Terms
<ul>
<li>Float: A float is created when a warp or weft ‘yarn’ is passed over two or more threads.</li>
<li>Shed: A shed is the opening created on a loom where the weft passes between the warp ‘yarn’.</li>
<li>Pick: A pick (also referred to as a shot) is a single pass of the weft through the ‘shed’.</li>
<li>Ends: Individual warp threads.</li>
<li>Yarn: Yarn is the generic term for a thin, long, continuous strand of textile fibre, filament, or material in a form suitable for knitting, weaving, or otherwise intertwining (or interlacing) to form a textile fabric.</ul></p>

<p><a href="http://store.turnbullandasser.co.uk/Materials_and_styling/Plain_Weave.html">Plain weave</a> is the most common and the tightest method of interlacing warp and weft. Each warp ‘yarn’ passes alternately over and under each weft. The interlacing is opposite in all neighbouring cells. Plain weave allows the highest possible number of interlacings which, depending on the fibre and ‘yarn’ type, the thread density and the finishing, can yield fabrics with high abrasion resistance and resistance to ‘yarn’ slippage.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.turnbullandasser.co.uk/Materials_and_styling/Lace_Weave.html">Lace weave</a> is formed using a combination of ‘floats’ created on a plain weave such that the illusion of small openings is created thus mimicking the appearance of lace.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://store.turnbullandasser.co.uk/Materials_and_styling/Twill_Weave.html">twill weave</a> the order of interlacing causes diagonal lines to appear in the fabric. The lines may run to the right, known as the Z direction, or they may run to the left, known as the S direction. On the reverse of the fabric the twill lines run in the opposite direction and are often less distinct. The twill effect can be accentuated by using different coloured warp and weft ‘yarns’.
</p>
<p>Warp-faced twills show a predominance of warp ‘yarns’ on the face whereas Weft-faced twills (sometimes called twillette) show a predominance of weft ‘yarns’ on the face.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.turnbullandasser.co.uk/Materials_and_styling/Grenadine_Weave.html">Grenadine</a> dates back to at least the 18th century when it was used for black silk lace scarves. It was once a popular dress fabric and takes the form of a fine leno-weave mesh. The leno weave is a locking type weave in which two or more warp threads cross over each other and interlace with one or more weft (filling) threads. It is used primarily to prevent shifting of fibres in open weave fabrics. Fabrics in leno weave are normally used in conjunction with other weave styles because if used alone their openness could not produce an effective composite component. The primary characteristics of Grenadine are that it has an open-weave effect, a low yarn count, good dimensional stability and lesser yarn slippage.</p>

<p>The appearance of <a href="http://store.turnbullandasser.co.uk/Materials_and_styling/Herringbone_Weave.html">herringbone weave</a> is exactly as its name implies, namely the shape of the skeletal remains of a Herring. This fishbone effect is created by reversing the direction of the twill weave at regular intervals; this causes the diagonal lines to reverse in direction.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.turnbullandasser.co.uk/Materials_and_styling/Houndstooth_Weave.html">The Houndstooth check pattern</a> originated in woven wool cloth of the Scottish Lowlands, but is now used in many other materials. The traditional Houndstooth check is made with alternating bands of four light threads in both warp and weft woven in a simple 2-2 twill, two over - two under the warp, advancing one thread each pass. The result of this broken twill weave is what can best be described as a four-pointed star check design.</p>

<p>The word moiré comes from the French word for "watered". In English, it originally referred to the shimmering quality of the French moiré silk. <a href="http://store.turnbullandasser.co.uk/Materials_and_styling/Moire_Weave.html">A moiré pattern</a> occurs when two or more different geometrically regular patterns are superimposed. A classic moiré pattern is composed of two sets of parallel lines that are at a slight angle. You can see this effect in real life if you go past two fences located one behind another. A moiré pattern does not necessarily have to be composed of lines. It can also be composed of circles, dots or any other repetitive pattern, consist of multiple colours, and be either moving or still. The essential quality of a moiré pattern is that a new pattern emerged from two existing ones. Often the new pattern seems to resonate or implies a depth not seen in the patterns individually.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.turnbullandasser.co.uk/Materials_and_styling/Repp_Weave.html">A Repp weave</a> is usually applied to a heavy or medium fabric and produces prominent and pronounced ribs (or ridges) in the finished cloth. A true Repp, which is no longer commonly made, is a plain weave fabric made with two warps, one fine and one coarse, the yarns arranged alternately and the fine warp more heavily tensioned than the coarse. Two wefts are used, one fine, one coarse alternately and the weave arranged so that the coarse warp is always lifted over the coarse weft. This creates very prominent ribs. More usually the term repp is given to almost every fabric of the plain weave type having prominent ribs, made on the plain weave fine warp and thicker weft principle and of a coarser and heavier construction than faille and poult.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.turnbullandasser.co.uk/Materials_and_styling/Ribbed_Weave.html">A rib fabric</a> is one where the surface shows raised lines or ridges. In a warp rib the ridge runs across the width of the fabric and is achieved with a high density of warp ‘ends’, where two or more weft ‘picks’ are placed in each ‘shed’. The warp ‘yarn’ is often finer than the weft and covers the surface of the fabric. A weft rib is the converse of a warp rib where the rib effect runs along the length of the fabric.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.turnbullandasser.co.uk/Materials_and_styling/Satin_Weave.html">Satin</a> is a weave and not a material. The description ‘Satin Bow Tie’ is in truth not the full description as many satin bow ties are made from Cotton rather than Silk.</p>

<p>The main feature of satin weaves is the uniform distribution of the interlacings, which are never adjacent to one another. A basic satin weave repeats over at least five ‘ends’ and five ‘picks’, but the warp ‘ends’ interlace only once. This type of weave pattern leads to the creation of long ‘floats’ which because of the scarcity of interlacings (and thread density) in turn produce the smooth, even and lustrous sheen often associated with satin.</p>

<p>English in origin and was originally created for use in mourning cloth. <a href="http://store.turnbullandasser.co.uk/Materials_and_styling/Barathea_Weave.html">Barathea</a> generally uses a worsted ‘yarn’ woven with a twill hopsack or broken rib weave. The resulting cloth has a fine texture with a slightly pebbled effect and faint regular twill lines running in opposite directions. Barathea, which has a matt finish, is used in many forms of formal wear including bow ties and cummerbunds.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.turnbullandasser.co.uk/Materials_and_styling/Self-On-Self_Weave.html">Self-on-self</a>, also known as Self Figure, is not a particular style of weave; rather it is a generic term for any weave that creates a pattern within the cloth where the weave of the design differs from the ground weave. Self-on-Self is generally employed on plain colours (most commonly white-on-white), the pattern being the same colour as the ground.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.turnbullandasser.co.uk/Materials_and_styling/End-On-End_Weave.html">End-on-end</a> (also known by its French name, Fil-a-Fil) is essentially a plain weave where one colour yarn is interwoven with another colour yarn. Although one of the two colours is usually White, a great variety of end-on-ends have been produced in recent years. This type of weave yields a familiar two-tone appearance. For end-on-end cloths that do not incorporate a white yarn then one of the yarn colours tends to be a darker shade of the same colour. For example Sky Blue might be used for the 'weft' yarn and Mid Blue for the 'warp' yarn.</p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Footwear Chronicles is following along from The Houndstooth Chronicles, The Craft Brew Chronicles etc. Regardless of topic or expertise I will chronicle my choices. (The Chronicles will be made clearer and given their own page... Real Soon Now&trade;)</p>

<p>Earlier editions have mentioned my <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2009/08/28/catching-up-on-a-busy-friday/">Camp Fours</a>, <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2009/06/24/worn-out-gear-5-10-camp-fours-are-the-new-hotness/">Guide Tennies</a> and <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2009/01/18/merrell-thermo-6-waterproof-recommended/">Thermo 6's</a>.</p>

<a href="http://www.limmercustomboot.com/"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/photo_2.jpg" alt="Photo_2.jpg" border="0" width="270" height="320" /></div></a>



<p>But since I'm getting more organized about my footwear choices... here's the first footwear that I read about and said to myself... yeah, that sounds right. I was 9 or 10 years old at the time.</p>

<p>We were on a summer vacation in the White Mountains of NH, and in a basket under a small table in the porch of the cabin was a stack of magazines. It was that worn time of day after hiking and swimming and playin' around when all parents are searching for some quiet time, and no doubt my mom was preparing dinner, or thinking about it anyway.</p>

<p>It was a little too stuffy in the cabin so I grabbed a jacket and plopped myself down on the chair and looked for something to read. The magazine came to hand and as I flipped through came across an article about hiking in the area, and a sidebar on <a href="http://www.limmercustomboot.com/">Limmer Boots</a>. It included a brief recount of Peter Limmer Sr. and how he "moved his family from the Boston area up to the White Mountains of New Hampshire because it reminded him of his home in Bavaria."</p>

<p>I've never known why the White Mountains appealed to my grandfather, but I always suspected his being from Germany played a role.</p>

<p>And the article continued to talk about the custom hiking boots, and I decided that it would be a delicious thing to have some boots made to the shape of my foot. It was a recognition in myself of a love of things that are "custom made" or "bespoke" that I can rarely afford to indulge.</p>

<p>So cut to many, many years later, and I drop by the shop to order custom boots, learn that they now make stock boots, and pick up a pair.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/limmer-stock-boots.jpg" alt="Limmer-Stock-Boots.jpg" border="0" width="598" height="268" /></div>

<p>See those boots over on the left? That's what they looked like. They're beautiful and solid, and supported my then very heavy body through quite a few miles. the wait list caught up to me shortly after September 11th and it seemed silly to indulge in custom boots at that point, with no big hikes or anything on my list of things to do. I passed on the chance. Years later, having walked off quite a few of those pounds the boots I had were too heavy for the kind of hiking I was doing and they no longer fit properly. So I dropped them off at the shop to be consigned, and picked up a new pair of the Lightweight Hikers... and have been happy ever since.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/dsc_0330.jpg" alt="DSC_0330.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="188" /></div>

<p>Yes, I do believe in going light when I hike. And sometimes that definitely means something lighter than even a lightweight leather boot. But's there's lots of times when I've been happy to have the support and protection. It's one of those things that either works for you or doesn't. Caveat Emptor. But that's about hiking (wilderness, packs, miles to go before you sleep sort of hiking). They're more than capable of handling the chores around the house or barn, weekends playing in the outdoors, hunting, fishing, etc. if you do those sorts of things.</p>

<p>All of us have things that make us smile when we see them. These are one of those things for me. Lisa loves hers as well, saying "nothing fits me like my Limmers." As a 10 year old, I never could have envisioned the life that has filled the 35 years between then and now. But I could picture my feet up in pair of Limmers, and the picture above tells that story better than I.</p>

<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Socks? My go-to in this case is <a href="http://www.bridgedale.com/">Bridgedale</a>. They never seem to wear out. Cushy, but not too thick. They no longer seem to make the model I have, but since they would appear to be years away from wearing out, I don't know what to tell you. Use whatever works for you...]</cite>

Keeps my ankles protected for those times when I begin to believe I can huck a bike off of anything, or when I just stumble over myself. Picked them up on clearance a couple years back and have no regrets. Looking particularly hip in this case with the <a href="http://www.panachecyclewear.com/">Panache Cycling</a> houndtooth socks.</p>

<p>Next up are my <a href="http://www.piloti.com/">Piloti</a> shoes. they don't seem to make this model anymore, which explains why they were also on clearance. About three years into the wearing, they're great shoes for a Sunday, or end of the week commute because they're designed for driving, and work reasonably well on a bike (A stiffer sole would help on the bike, but would probably lose some of the sensitivity that makes them work so well when driving). The round heel cup and extended edging make for comfortable driving, even if you get into a bit of heel and toe work, but there's enough cush to make errands, shopping, and other weekend activities a pleasure.</p>

<p>Don't be fooled, Piloti makes serious race shoes if you're part of the horsepower set, and they're well made touring shoes look is well designed for the Concours folks. But I find that for a day in and out of the car, or longer trips they're an excellent choice. The fit and finish on these is excellent and the more luxurious versions can easily hide in an office where no one will know that in your head you're taking the off camber on your favorite twisty mountain road.</p>

<p>On this day, they're paired with <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/merino-socks/">Rapha merino wool socks</a> (the black with the pink accent.) Nice.</p>

<p>Some mornings require Stormy Kromer. The pics don't tell the quality story. They started out as a cap company because 'ol Stormy got tired of his hats flyin' away. The best products always seem to start this way. As usual, picked up on clearance. I'm not avant when it comes to clothes. Matched today with the <a href="http://www.twinsix.com/gear/mens-casual/batoutofhell-t">"Bat Out Of Hell T" from Twin Six</a>, which sadly you can't get. (A limited edition). You can't really see it in the product shot, but it's leaves beneath the bicycles wheels that turn into bats. a beautiful touch. Yeah, I look like autumn today, but then it was 37F when I walked out the door this morning...can you blame me? I thought not.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4009426717/">TapLynx out of the box...</a>

<p>The <a href="http://www.taplynx.com/">TapLynx framework</a> in action. 35 minutes from never having seen it to a working app with some changed icons, colors, splash screen and my feeds. (and most of that was messing around with graphics.) Rockin!!</p>

<p>Congrats to everyone at Newsgator!</p>

<p>Brent and I have a long history... especially for two people who've never met in person. And many times in the past I've had the fun of being the first person to get some technology he worked on running outside the lab. It goes back at least to the <a href="http://www.scripting.com/twentyFour/">24 hours of Democracy</a> project, <a href="http://manila.userland.com/">Manila</a>, and others. So it was cool to find out that I was granted this opportunity again... and that TapLynx worked great out of the box.</p>

		<title>Outlier Tailored Performance (The Houndstooth Chronicles)</title>

<p>I'm not sure where I came across Outlier, but I thought it was cool that couple guys in Brooklyn, were creating clothes for the tween space between on bike and off. It's hard to make things work in both environments, it takes serious effort. I also dug that they were having the clothes made in NYC. I have some family connection to the "Shmata" trade, and I'm all for local sourcing and direct trade.

Occasionally they experiment with stuff publicly and make a few of an item. I think the first piece I grabbed was the Workwear Hoodie. The durable Workwear fabric ( Schoeller Dry Skin Extreme + Nanosphere) has worn extremely well. I haven't taken any spills in it (thankfully) but it puts up with everything my rambuctious 4 year old can throw at it... Cookie and cracker crumbs, water, chocolate, miscellaneous dirt from goodness knows where have all rolled off. The fabric exterior is a canvas like nylon, and the inside a softish fleece that is warm and comfortable against the skin. It dries fast too, although it takes a lot to get it wet. The cut is clean and a bit smaller than is generally found in American brands. If you want to wear it with sweaters underneath order up. I find myself wearing this piece a lot as a spring/autumn jacket, and a layer through the winter. The helmet sized hood makes it a great piece to pair with a hoodless jacket. The<a href="http://www.patagonia.com/web/us/product/mens-nano-puff-pullover?p=84020-0-465"> Patagonia Nano Puff</a> I recently started to wear leaps to mind. Awesome stuff.</p>
<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/outlier-nail-ltblue-profile.jpg" alt="outlier-nail-ltblue-profile.jpg" border="0" width="350" height="234" align="right">
<p>The next couple of pieces I ordered together. The <a href="http://outlier.cc/2009/08/nailhead_cap.php#details">Nailhead Cap</a> and the <a href="http://outlier.cc/2009/03/empire_merino_tee.php">Empire Merino Tee</a>. I'll go ahead and quote directly: "Nailhead is one of our favorite worsted wools around. Its subtle pinprick pattern gives it an incredible depth of texture, and as a fine suiting fabric it tends to be made from the softest and longest wool fibers available. That makes it one of the best performance fabrics in the world, but you'd never know since it tends to be used in expensive men's suits and nothing but." I can tell you that the cap is comfy, looks good whether I'm dressed down (as I usually am) in jeans and a sweater, or dressed up in a long wool coat. I've worn it every day since I got it. As with almost all hats, I could use a version where the crown to ear depth is shorter... but it's close, close.
</p>
<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/img_1285.jpg" alt="IMG_1285.JPG" border="0" width="144" height="181" align="right">
<p>I added the Empire T because Merino is darn comfortable. I love all the clothes I have that use this wonderful stuff, and the execution here is spot on. Yeah, in the end it's an expensive T-Shirt, but it is one that you can wear as a base layer, or not. It'll keep you cool and warm. It'll do all that even if it gets wet... and it *doesn't* become as odiferous as new fangled technical materials seem to. Wool is the original, and as far as I'm concerned most super, fabric. Properly chosen and tailored it's perfect whether in a favorite houndstooth lightweight pant, a <a href="http://www.filson.com/sm-mackinaw-cruiser--pi-2092310.html">Filson Mackinaw</a> jacket, or this excellent shirt. I only wish I could afford a passle of them.</p>

<p>I'd love to try some of the pants they've made, but I really need to try on pants since I have short legs, and prefer a short rise, especially on the bike. Maybe if I beg, Abe &amp; Tyler will send me some... </p>

<p>Anyway, go check out there stuff. Designed and manufactured here in New York City with amazing fabric and materials. While they put out a "hipster" vibe, it's not required. The designs are flexible enough to apply to us plain ole' workin' dads and our bikes.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/img_0360.jpg" alt="IMG_0360.jpg" border="0" width="240" height="320" align="right" /><p>You keep asking. I keep answering. No, It's not like me to discuss this stuff publicly, it's just clothes and stuff... I do enjoy the search for <a href="http://vividexcellence.com/">beautiful things that work</a> (hmmm, sounds like a tag line) and I am happy to share. In the end, find stuff you love and wear it down to a nubbin.</p>

<p>I don't know where I first learned about <a href="http://www.quocpham.com/">Quoc Pham</a>'s shoes, but I loved the simple bike friendly design. And without going over the top, they fit into the office wear easily. (In case it hasn't become clear, that is a persistent theme "clothes and products that work on and off the bike".)</p>
<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/img_0364.jpg" alt="IMG_0364.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="244" align="left" />
<p>They were not sold through any "stockists," as the Brits say, here in the US, and I decided that working through a 3rd party internationally was going to be a bad idea for shoes, but not too long after Quoc wrote saying he'd updated his website and I could order shoes directly from him. One of the joys of working with small companies and individuals—essentially "direct trade", is that there's a person there and they give a darn. Strange that personal attention from someone selling a product is of note.</p>

<p>The shoes are elegant looking and functioning. You can't see the pedal ready support or the just enough flexibility for comfortable walking. The sole's slim profile hides the mechanics of the shoe and supports the sensual lines of the last. The stitching and finishing work is excellent. The heel cup is right on. There is a slash of reflective material on the back of the heel, but it doesn't intrude or scream bike shoe as much as some. The tongue is attached on one side and Quoc reviews <a href="http://www.quocpham.com/lt/index.html">lacing on his website</a>. He makes other colors and styles, go get yourself a pair.</p>

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/img_0347.jpg" alt="IMG_0347.jpg" border="0" width="122" height="160" align="right" /><p>Recently I mentioned the <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/web/us/product/mens-nano-puff-pullover?p=84020-0-465">Patagonia Nano Puff</a>. This piece's purpose is simple. It fits beneath virtually everything I wear as outerwear, it can be worn by itself since it has a DWR coating, is very warm for its weight, and can be packed into its own chest pocket, which has a loop so that you can hang off any handy clip (or a 'biner). Plus, it's orange! You can't go wrong with orange.</p>

<p>A word about the warmth. I used to be "the warm guy" requesting the seat under the air conditioner vent at work. I used to walk about with nothing more than windbreaker for most of the winter. But since I started cholesterol meds and aspirin I've been cold a lot of the time. I wear sweaters in air conditioned spaces all summer. Clothing that is warm and lightweight has become very important to my ability to focus on anything other than "I'm cold." So when I say warm for its weight, it's important to me that it has a slim profile, doesn't weigh much and is warm. Warm and bulky is easy. Warm and light is not.</p>

<p>Now you're going to have forgive the picture, as I grabbed this snap in a mirror on my way out the door at 6 o'dark this morning with phone camera... and I was also trying to display the <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/silk-scarf/">Rapha scarf</a> I got as a gift form my wife a year or so ago. I can sometimes pull off wearing it in an "of course" sort of way. Other times I rip it from my neck as I realize with horror that I look like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popinjay">popinjay</a>. This picture leans in that direction, but not when I actually zipped up the jacket to go out, only in my attempt to display it. It does a great job of filling the space between collars and neck, and quiets the drafts wonderfully well. But it is well executed, in terms of size (not too large, not too small) and the simple gear pattern that form the background. BTW, I'm not alone in my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1176359@N20/pool/">appreciation of the scarf</a>.</p>

<p>As always, you'd know none of this if you saw me walking down the street. And for my sense of comfort and style, that is also key.</p>

Fortunately there's a site devoted to the topic the <a href="http://dailydropcap.com/">Daily Drop Cap</a>. How convenient! Except it's almost impossible to find any past examples since there's no collection of links, and obscure urls etc. ah well. I can go with the flow.</p>

<p>All from <a href="http://jhische.com/">Jessica Hische</a> over in Brooklyn. Lovely.</p>


<p>From earlier this week another casual shot of the work place...<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/img_0359.jpg" alt="IMG_0359.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="240" /></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>NY Bottle Deposit  for &#039;water drinks&#039; Starts On Halloween</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://feeds.gothamistllc.com/click.phdo?i=33c4c4d336097f73b4e0a8d6f15055d1">Bottle Deposit Starts On Halloween</a>: Starting this coming Saturday, bottled water drinks will be subject to a nickel deposit—and the NY State government will be able to collect millions from the unclaimed deposits.  Governor Paterson <a href="http://ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/107845/judge--bottle-deposit-back-on-tap/">said</a>, "The expansion of this legislation not only provides our State with much-needed revenue, but will also help us to keep our neighborhoods and parks clean."</p>

<p>The law was supposed to go into effect in June, but some bottlers had argued that it was <a href="http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=804526&amp;category=BUSINESS">going into effect too soon</a>, especially since NY State requires bottles sold here to have a special UPC. Which means some distribution and logistical issues; Environmental Leader <a href="http://www.environmentalleader.com/2009/04/09/new-yorks-nickel-water-bottle-deposit-raises-ire-of-distributors-retailers/">points out</a>, &quot;For instance, a distributor can’t simply restock New York shelves with product from a New Jersey warehouse unless it bears the unique code.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2009/10/businesses_scramble_to_prepare.html">Post-Standard explains</a>, "For consumers, the change is simple enough. Beginning at 12 a.m. Saturday, they will pay a nickel deposit on bottles of water, just as they do for soda and beer.

Bottled water is bad idea. It always has been. I'll admit that there a few times when bottled water makes sense. A few very special cases. Most of the time, tap water is fine. If you're really super finicky, filter that as well. But by far most of the time plain old tap water carried in a reusable and hopefully recyclable or upcyclable container is the way to go. Lately the word is to watch out for BPA and linings made with BPA (metal cans, and some metal water bottles. Anyway... stop pretending that bottled water is worth the environmental impact of shipping this expensive and heavy item anywhere. We're lucky that in most places in the US water is clean, healthy, and abundant. And save yourself needless tithing to the State. My disclaimer here is that as a hiker I've pulled water from sources that would make city folk vomit, although I did carry a filter and stuff (which never improves (ahem) brackish water), but did seem to keep me safe.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://inessential.com/2009/10/29/vaccines">Brent</a> on his piece on vaccines: <blockquote><p>An <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/10/29/wired-vaccinations">interesting link on Daring Fireball</a> today has me thinking about vaccines.
</p>
<p>I’m still living with the effects of the chicken pox I had in third grade.</p></blockquote>

<p>As a parent this is a complicated issue. I'll get back to that.</p>

<p>It was the in thing when I was just a wee lad to expose your kids to Chicken Pox when the neighborhood kids etc. got it, because it was usually a fairly benign thing, and it was thought to better get it over with now, and then they'll be done with it. As Brent points out, that's not always the case.</p>

<p>For better or worse in my case, it never worked anyway. I never caught them and neither did my brother or sister.</p>

<p>Cut to the end of my first year in college. I go to visit a friend for the weekend, and we in turn go to eat lunch at his brother's apartment. After we get there, there's whispering between the brothers, and my friend turns to me saying "You've had the chicken pox haven't you?" Um, no. Too late now it would seem. And of course, I caught a case from that tiny little baby (where you couldn't even really see the pox they were so tiny, and the case so weak (seemingly).</p>

<p>Unlike Brent, I did not get a horrible case. Oh yeah, I looked like hell, but it wasn't that itchy, and the fever etc was really far worse than the pox in my case. The timing was bad, as I had a must not miss senior recital to play on Wednesday (The itching and breakout started Friday night), and the senior in question was panicking at the rehearsals I was missing, but other than that... I felt pretty good by Monday morning, and while I had some makeup on and felt weak I actually played in that recital. Thankfully that was before the time of the ubiquitous digital camera.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my sister caught it from me, and her case was far, far, worse. She had pox in ears and throat etc. and was incredibly uncomfortable. I still feel bad about that, though there was nothing I could do. My brother never did catch them, and years later got the vaccine either when his kids got them or the vaccine I forget which.</p>

<p>Fortunately for all concerned, the worst of it is a pox mark reminder here or there. I've been marked worse from playing gigs in bars overall.</p>

<p>As a parent there's a bunch of issues. One is the "are vaccines really the right approach for all diseases." For example in the case of influenza which changes so rapidly is there any clear scientific proof that the shot you get actually helps you not get sick? With a thankfully strong immune system, I've had the flu once in my life (not that it was any fun). So despite my doctor "insisting" that I get a flu shot is it having any effect? And if it isn't, is it worth the risk?</p>

<p>The same thinking applies to all the stuff that Noah gets. And further there are the issues surrounding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiomersal">Thiomersal</a>(commonly known in the United States as thimerosal) which is almost 50% Mercury and is used in the multi-dose versions of all (almost all?) vaccines. And even if you think any tie to Autism is bunk, should it be risked? Fortunately, it is not contained in most regular childhood single dose vaccines, but you still need to check. And in the end, is it worth the risk? Thimerosal is known to be very toxic by inhalation, ingestion, and in contact with skin with a danger of cumulative effects. And I should have some portion of this <strong>injected</strong> into my baby? Seriously? <strong>SERIOUSLY?</strong> Don't bother talking to me about micrograms...</p>

<p>Noah has had all his "shots" and we are careful to make sure that they are free of toxins etc as much as possible, and I consider it for myself and Lisa every time the Doc pushes a flu shot or some such. But every shot bring s a sleepless night or two. And how much Mercury has accumulated in my system between the shots and the tuna and who knows what else (Solder fumes anyone?) What's the tipping point that turns me into the Mad Hatter?</p>

<p>This is not easy stuff, and I understand the concerns of both sides, but it is clear that the functioning of living organisms is not well understood by the medical community. No blame here, just a fact from my perspective. Sure they know a lot compared to 100 years ago, but do they really understand? C'mon. And with that being the case, it is hard to take their arguments seriously except from a statistical basis. If you treat people as numbers it works. But if you think of them as people, the "greater good" arguments get harder to listen to as I get older.</p>

<p>I don't know what the right thing is for everyone, or anyone. But I think that everyone needs to consider issues like this and not blindly follow anyone else's advice. <strong>That</strong> I can advocate with a clear conscience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I struggled too with Gray and his vaccinations.  We held off on a bunch of them until 1) I could decide if it was the right thing 2) his system was a little more developed.  At times, we were berated by the doctor and had been refused treatment because of our refusal of some vaccines.  It was a tough road. Ultimately we did get them, but always with the sleepless nights. And always, we got the single doses, not the multi.

I never get the flu shot, ever. A few years ago I had influenza (not just the "common cold") and that was bad, and at the end of the school year last year I had H1N1. Annoying, but not horrific. 

I'm not getting any shots this year.  
Hey, exercise keeps the immune system strong!  Allez.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Suffering in November</title>
		<link>http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2009/11/01/suffering-in-november/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/photo-4.jpg" alt="photo 4.jpg" border="0" width="195" height="320" align="left" />It never did warm up. Well, maybe it did, but not when we were riding. It stayed cloudy and cool, breezy and chilled, but at least there were hills and suffering.</p>

<p>Most of the time, by November I'm in full break mode. It's often cloudy and uninviting around here. My comrades in bikes are either simply disinterested, not interested in fighting the cold, or healing from a long season. Winter riding is here soon enough and November and December also have holidays and families and other things that seem to severely limit riding time. So I go with the flow and accept the generally inevitable, setup the rollers and trainer and begin prepping for the winter to come.<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/photo-2_4.jpg" alt="photo 2_4.jpg" border="0" width="135" height="320" align="right" /></p>

<p>But I'm not there yet. I had a break caused by weekends full of high holiday and the general busyness at work. And while I've snuck a ride in chockablock, as a friend would say, it has lacked rhyme and reason, purpose and flow. I was on the verge of getting my mountain bike into winter mode (a change in tires and gears) but put it off since there's a chance that I'll get to join some other friends on a trail ride. Slim, but worth holding out for... and after that it'll be nice to feel the smooth bump absorbing float of those big fat tires again.</p>

<p>But today was a day for the smell of hardwood fires, splashing leaves, the burble of brooks. The air lacked crispness, it was just mushy and wettish, chilling to the bone given the chance, but it wasn't upsetting the cameraderie. Certainly I gave it no such chance. I broke out my woolie <a href="http://www.ibexwear.com/shop/product/1474/8990/mens-el-fito-bib-three-quarter">Ibex El Fito Bib Knickers</a>, a synthetic base layer on top and then three favorite Rapha pieces, the <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/long-sleeve-jersey-09/">long sleeve jersey</a>, the <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/lightweight-softshell-jacket">lightweight softshell jacket</a> and keeping the draft from my neck, <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/winter-collar/">the winter collar</a>. Would twere that I could afford to buy this stuff in season. Ah well. But my wife always picks me up something when the sales start. She's especially lovely that way. As I said earlier, it was supposed to warm up but didn't. I was expecting to toss the top layers into a pocket as I went. Never came close. I was warm when climbing and okay the rest of the time, but I prefer feeling warm to cool and didn't because of the breeze, the moist air and my own thin, aging, blood. Didn't stop me from having a great time, I assure you.<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/photo-2_3.jpg" alt="photo 2_3.jpg" border="0" width="240" height="320" align="left" /></p>

<p>As you can see from the elevation chart, this short ride was not without its challenges. We headed for the hills and the suffering ensued. I was not the only one who hadn't been riding recently. The beauty of the surroundings provided needed distraction. We climb into a state park... so there's an abundance of burbling brooks and splashing streams. Conifers and hardwoods. Pine scent wafting gently by as you ride by certain sections. An oasis in a generally urban area. And occasionally someone nearby has a fire going and the faint smell of roasting hardwood is all you have to alert you to the fact. I had hoped for indian summer, I got a mixed bag, but the hills are just as crushing yet uplifting in November as they are in June or August.</p>

<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/img_0385_2.jpg" alt="IMG_0385_2.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="108" align="right" />The water levels in the lakes were down (to my surprise) since last I was in the park. It seems like there's been plenty of rain lately thus my surprise. But I'm not sure who controls the levels, nature or mankind, as there are gates and valves seen here or there, and maybe they were allowing the lakes to spill off before the winter. We shot across the park with the intent of crossing over to Route 17, but someone had a change of heart and so we climbed back up Johnstown road and looped back down the hills we had just climbed (I took it easy today and held my top speed to 41mph). We cut through what was an old orphanage strange in its juxtaposition against a golf course and then completed the loop.</p>

<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/screen-shot-2009-11-01-at-5-23-16-pm_2.jpg" alt="Screen shot 2009-11-01 at 5.23.16 PM_2.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="74" align="left" />The road leads ever onward and todays ride, mostly with folks I've known for a long time now, was perfect for the day. No pressure, no ripping each others legs off, no sprints. Just a cruise of the countryside and some suffering from the hills. Just enough of everything to keep things interesting. As hilly as it is where I live it is hard to put together a ride that doesn't contain some climbing. You'd really have to ride to other side of the county to begin to make that happen, and the ride across the county would not be hill free. But what are bike rides without climbing? Wind fights? Far more demoralizing than the hills, I assure you.</p>

<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/screen-shot-2009-11-01-at-5-23-34-pm_2.jpg" alt="Screen shot 2009-11-01 at 5.23.34 PM_2.jpg" border="0" width="279" height="320" align="left" /><a href="http://epicmoonflower.wordpress.com/2009/11/01/the-roygibv-ride/">Jenni has more pictures</a> of the folks on the ride.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that cyclists throw the word suffering around a bit. Yes, it is a term of art. But there's suffering on a bike, or suffering the hills, and then there's parents watching their sick children struggle with illness. I try never to forget that the bit of suffering I almost enjoy on the bike for my health does not equate to the suffering of those who are fighting to rebuild their health. If there is glory in suffering it belongs to those who conquer the unimagineable. It's why I try to <a href="http://quietlyhelping.org/">quietly help</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://www.speedgoat.com/blog.asp?p=2067">New FTC Guidelines Governing Blogs Featuring Products</a>: <blockquote>We thought you should know that the Federal Trade Commission just published new <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/10/endortest.shtm">guidelines</a> about - among other things - blogs that feature product endorsements.
<br>
<br>That sure caught my attention.
<br>
<br>The Guides, which have been around since 1980, have been freshened up to "specify that while decisions will be reached on a case-by-case basis, the post of a blogger who receives cash or in-kind payment to review a product is considered an endorsement. Thus, bloggers who make an endorsement must disclose the material connections they share with the seller of the product or service."
<br>
<br>Then I breathed a huge sigh of relief. 
<br>
<br>See, there's a seedy underbelly to  media where some journalists - crappy, amoral journalists for sure (there are many names for these people: swag hags, freebie queens, whores, shills) - but still journalists, who too enthusiastically accept gifts (like bikes and components), giveaways, expensive meals, all-expenses-paid trips and the like in exchange for editorial coverage. If you're a keen reader, you can probably already spot this perversion, aptly called "advertorial." So far it has flown silently under the radar because the FTC has no authority to regulate speech unless it's specifically commercial speech.
<br>
<br>The new guidelines surfaced due to a recent spate of bloggers trumpeting the virtues of a product that they were either given or were paid to endorse.</blockquote>
<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Just to be clear... anything I write about is something that either I purchased or a friend purchased and I've used. The exception that comes to mind is stuff donated to <a href="http://quietlyhelping.org/">QuietlyHelping.org</a> but I will include in the context of the piece that it was donated. I'll happily except stuff for review, as I already do with books, and occasionally other stuff, but if it appears here, you will know when I was given something. Otherwise you can safely assume I hauled out my wallet.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There's a lot of real life catching up to do. And I promise... soon. In the meantime, this is how I started my day:

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/img_1487_3.jpg" alt="IMG_1487_3.jpg" border="0" width="640" height="359" /></div>

<p>It looked like this when I woke up this morning, so it was clear I needed to go for a ride. Maybe not the sanest of thoughts for someone who has been as cold ridden as I, but I couldn't miss the opportunity. Nope. Not. My lungs hurt from the cold at first, but I, they, and the air warmed some as I went.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/img_1495_2.jpg" alt="IMG_1495_2.jpg" border="0" width="640" height="359" /></div>

<p>I forget how much fun riding in fresh snow can be. It was fat and fluffy. It makes that great crunchy noise as you ride, but everything else is incredibly quiet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/sets/72157622947130918/">A few more pics here</a>. Too bad more of my friends couldn't join me...</p>


<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/img_1524_2.jpg" alt="IMG_1524_2.jpg" border="0" width="640" height="359" /><p>King Hubs!</p></div>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/img_1527_2.jpg" alt="IMG_1527_2.jpg" border="0" width="640" height="359" /><p>Front Fork</p></div>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/img_1514_2.jpg" alt="IMG_1514_2.jpg" border="0" width="640" height="359" /><p>Jeff Jones FTW!</p></div>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/img_1523_2.jpg" alt="IMG_1523_2.jpg" border="0" width="640" height="359" /><p>Drivetrain</p></div>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/sets/72157622947130918/show/with/4162647955/">Slideshow</a>. And for all the what'd you wear folks... a super light summer short with pad, <a href="http://www.shopvermarcusa.com/">Vermarc Roubaix Bib Tights</a> (no chamois), a <a href="http://www.sugoi.ca/">Sugio Speedster 2</a> as an underlayer with the hood on, <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/">Rapha</a> winter jersey, <a href="http://www.pearlizumi.com/">Pearl Izumi jacket and gloves</a> etc. <a href="http://www.smartwool.com/">Smartwool Phd</a> socks, shoes were the<a href="http://www.lakecycling.com/"> Lake MXZ302</a> (the full winter boot in the mtb, fully walkable style... much better for winter than the road shoe). I think that was it. Ya'll need to get lives caring what I wear... just wear whatever makes you comfortable...</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The 4 Sisters Nussbaum</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life turns on a dime. I'll get back to that.</p>

<p>Almost 100 years ago there were 4 sisters.</p>

<p>Now there's only one left. My Oma (grandmother), my father's mother.</p>

<p>The first sister perished in World War II. All things considered, it should inform you of the nature of that Nussbaum family and the ladies they raised that only one was lost in the Holocaust. I can't (and frankly refuse to try) to imagine the pain of losing a sibling, and then under those circumstances, while enduring the difficulty of the time and place. The three remaining sisters managed to safely flee Germany, although that poorly constructed sentence doesn't begin to illuminate the story.</p>

<p>On Friday I went to visit my Oma, having last seen her briefly at the funeral of her sister, who I knew as "Tante Ellie" (The spelling is all mine). Of course, she was never my Aunt, but my Great Aunt, but that was her "name" to us at least. Tante Ellie has four children (and now many grandchildren and great grandchildren.) Tante Ellie was 89 as of last week at her funeral. She had been written off by her doctors almost 13 years ago. At the time they said she would never leave the hospital. But she and all her sisters are made of sterner stuff than most of us.</p>

<p>I can't say that I spent a lot of time with my Great Aunt over the years, and as is often the way of these things I saw more of her when I was little, and my parents and their parents and siblings were younger as well. So I have a child's fond memory of her—her regal carriage, and a voice that always made me think of Julia Child. There was always a bit of an interview when I saw her, catching up on my life and what I was up to, with a touch of judgement, but lacking that inquisition quality some folks bring to that process. She had a gentle nature and it showed. She's already deeply missed.</p>

<p>When I still rather little, my Opa passed away of heart attack. Things were different then, heart attacks more often than not killed people. My Oma was a young 50 something, and certainly could have found someone if she wished. But my Oma has never been unwed for a moment—there has never been a moment when she was not married despite his passing all those years ago. She found work, made a life for herself in two different places, and to this day lives by herself in a small, unassuming house, where things remain as spotless and clean as one could want. There are certain things around that house that have existed in their place (the towel dispenser above the sink) for my entire life, and to my recollection existed in her two apartments and now here house. There is a lesson there for all of us who are more fickle and frivolous with belongings.</p>

<p>When I was twelve I met my Oma's other sister. My parents had long planned a trip to Israel to see the Land, and meet the family we hadn't met until that point. Oma's sister wore similar glasses, hair style, and clothes. She looked like a twin more than a sister. And of course, carried herself with the same regal dignity. Her voice more similar to my grandmother than to my great aunt's. Surprising considering how many years they had lived apart at that point. Unfortunately, it was difficult to build a relationship with her as she and I had no real common language, and she clearly wanted it understood that I was not to touch anything, sit still, and generally behave. I was not terribly good at any of those things.</p>

<p>I'm sitting across from my Oma having caught up on the general news she was interested in discussing (jobs, living places, my little one) despite the fact that this is all material we've gone over before. Her near term memory is not always that good, and a lot has changed around me in the last 7 years. Then we spoke about her sister for a few moments,and she ended with... "One second she's here like any of us, and the next she's gone. Like she was never here."</p>

<p>I can't imagine that anyone who knew my Tante Ellie  would say that her passing removed her presence "like she was never here." Her impact went and will go far beyond her family and its generations. But I'm quite certain that to my Oma, the last of the sisters, bereft of her husband all these years, who's strength of will in her late nineties remains inestimable—who at the funeral of her last living sister was asked how she was fairing and answered by saying "I'm strong inside" and keeping her feelings to herself, where in her opinion they belong. She has a clear understanding of the passage of time and people and I'm in no position to contradict her.</p>

<p>I use the phrase "Life turns on dime."</p>

<p>One second you're cruising along in your car and the next second a drunk person is smashing through your windshield. One second your shopping and the next second a homeless person is tossing chairs at your wife and daughter. One second your just riding along, and the next second your covered in road rash and you hurt places you didn't know you had. One second you're chasing a hoola-hoop, and the next second you're staring at the sky wondering what happened after the guy making the strange face in the purplish car hit you...</p>

<p>Larry was, from all accounts, a smart, funny guy. Not too long ago, he found a smart and charming woman and they married. They were planning their future and were on the verge of buying a condo together. Larry didn't feel well, and rapidly found himself in the hospital. Multi-system organ failure ensued... Larry passed away 3 weeks after he first didn't feel well. 3 weeks ago I went to Larry's funeral as the woman in this story is family friend.</p>

<p>I have no great lesson to impart at the end of this. But be aware that life turns on a dime, and in a split second everything you think you know and count on—down to your very existence—can stop or alter in ways that make it "like you were never here". Make the most of that.</p>

<p>My "Tante Ellie's" real name was Danielle Chaya. A lyrical name that matched her spirit.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The winter has always been a time of reflection and renewal. In part because of the year end, in part because of my upcoming birthday, and in part because it is the nature of the season. Plants and animals rest and slow down and recharge for the birthing, feeding and caring of young, replenishing stores, and enjoying the few lazy days of summer.</p>

<p>Being an artist for so many years (can one stop being an artist having been one?) it was a cherished time to reflect and dig deep. To stay in the "shed" and excavate the next layer of ideas.</p>

<p>There is less time... far less time for that process now. It's too bad. Retrospection is key aspect of my life, both personally and professionally. It is the most important element of my personal daily practice. What did I do? Was it right and true? Plumb and square? What can I do better next time? What can I fix or improve now? Using the winter as longer period of contemplation is an important part of the annual cycle. The solstice marked the start of this period for many years. Now there's far less time, and far greater demands on my time. So be it.</p>

<p>I'm so thankful for the wonderful year we've all had. I'm very much looking forward to next year, the challenges already arising and the joy and happiness already present. So to all of you, enjoy your time, the holidays you celebrate, your family, days off from work, and maybe playing in the snow. Whatever you do, do it joyously, make every minute count. Merry met &amp; merry part &amp; merry met again.</p>

<p>And specifically to my riding friends... get out and ride!</p>

		<title>A Year on the Hed Ardennes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/hed-ardennes.jpg" alt="hed_ardennes.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="208" /></div>

<p>A <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2008/12/14/hed-ardennes/">year ago I started riding</a> <a href="http://www.hedcycling.com/wheels/ardennes_c2.asp">Hed Ardennes</a>. So what do I think?</p>

<p>They've been really great. There's been no mechanical problems. They've stayed true except the one time I bashed the rear wheel into a <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2009/07/06/feels-like-summer/">pot hole</a> at speed, and even then they were barely out of true.</p>

<p>The ride remains excellent, although I did not help them along by running Schwalbe Ultremos. Compared to the far more supple casings, these felt harsh. But the <a href="http://www.torelli.com/tubes-tires-maintenance/tires/gavia-open-tubular.html">Torelli Gavias (320)</a> or <a href="http://www.vittoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9750&amp;Itemid=116">Vittoria Open Corsa Evo CX (290)</a> we're both amazing. When I switched to light tubes and tires ride quality went down, but so did weight. That's not why I switched, it was just trying something new, but there was a qualitative difference in the ride for me. I'm definitely going to try the light tubes with one of the other rubber combos and see how that feels.</p>

<p>I brought these wheels to <a href="http://cyclesportonline.com/">Cyclesport</a> and Ramon immediately <span style="color:red;">checked and replaced my Ultremo's under the <a href="http://www.schwalbetires.com/ultremo_warning_home">recall</span></a>. That's the sort of stuff that a good shop does without a thought. Thanks to Ramon, Dean, Juan, &amp; Mike. Juan is the best tech who's ever worked on my bikes. All Ya'll rock though!</p>

<p>While I'm at it, Glenn, Billy, &amp; Juan over at the <a href="http://www.piermontbike.com/">Piermont Bicycle Connection</a> take good care of me and my bikes as well. I often ride in that area and they're never too busy to take a moment to tweak something that's wrong, or in general make sure that I'm on a safe ride. I'm lucky to have a bunch of good shops in the area, although none of them are close enough to become "the one" for me. But as an example, Billy's built a bunch of excellent wheels for me... King or Surly hubs, Mavic or Salsa rims, various spokes depending on what I was trying to accomplish. A good shop.</p>

<p>Anyway... All the usual qualities apply to the C2 rimmed Ardennes. They accelerate, they have that awesome ability to transfer from side to side smoothly which comes from the added width of the rim. I do enjoy that feeling compared to the edgier feel of standard width rim. As the industry at large turns to wider rims (For example the new Zipp 303 has a wide width) brake manufacturers will make sure they're stuff works. I think the major brakes (Shimano, SRAM, Campy) all work now, but some specialty brakes like the Zero Gravity brakes I took off my bike last year still don't work with them. Considering how many wheels are still 19mm it might be a while... so make sure your brakes work or be prepared to replace them. I just dropped a pair of REVL carbon brakes on my bike. We'll see how that goes soon.</p>

<p>What it has come down to is that I'd like a second set of C2 based wheels, and am considering that for this year. I'll be looking into that shortly. Putting more rubber on the road has been a really good feeling thing for me. I did it with every bike I own. I have fat rims on my mountain bike (Salsa Gordo rims, 35mm width), big 33c tires on the commuter, and the Ardennes on the carbon rocket. There are more choices now than before,  they make two less expensive options now, as well as the top end Flame Rouge version with ceramic bearings and titanium spokes. One year later? Recommended.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The tech world spins quickly though. Curious to see what's next. In all cases though, it's not the tech or the code but the people. All these projects or companies have seriously dedicated people working on them. *That* is what makes these things go. Rock on people.</p>

<p>This is what happens when your tech doesn't tighten the QR on your semi horizontal dropout bike (The wheel pulled to rub against the chainstay). Plus you get dropped by jackasses on what is supposed to be a slow training ride.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In late December when Lance Armstrong tweeted: "Epic ride . . . 115 miles, 6.5 hrs, 10k ft climbing, 5300 Kjs. Sunny and 70 most of the day til we finished in the dark."</p>

<p>To us mere mortals that's an average of 17.7 mph (28.5 kph) on a mountainous training ride. Ouch.</p>

<p>In part it explains why the story of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/health/nutrition/31fitness.html?_r=1&amp;hpw">Joao Correia, who lost 60 lbs. and is riding for Cervelo Test Team</a> is so compelling. Inside of each and every person is a voice that says, if I could only train more, drop the weight, I too, could be a pro. (Hey people, try and remember he was a pro before he gained that weight, *you,* most likely, were not.)</p>

<p>I've been fascinated by that voice since I was a little boy. I know the truth now. I've played with top notch football players who were going to the NFL combines and not quite making it. I've played on fields, and courts, played chess against masters... I love learning my current limits. It just extends my reach.</p>

<p>I've also been on bike rides with Cat 1 &amp; 2 racers (who are still not pro level) and as usual, what they do on a bike and what I do on a bike are only similar in the broadest sense. That's cool. I don't aspire to be a pro or even race. But there's always a little voice inside of me that says... if only. That voice makes anything possible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Anticipation... arrival</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/img_4580.jpg" alt="IMG_4580.JPG" border="0" width="800" height="533" /></div>

<p>This story starts 2 years ago in early February. A person (to be named later) was posting pictures (the pic above is his as well) about a newly built bike. I had some questions, wrote to him, and learned a few things. Several months and a bike sale later, I was looking to build something similar adjusted for my situation. But the bike business is a tweaky one at times, and my LBS couldn't easily become a dealer, and paying retail (which my LBS would have done for me) seemed wrong, and at that point paying retail directly to the company (an option) seemed wrong too. I really think it's important to support local businesses.</p>

<p>So I took my thoughts in a slightly different direction and built the <a href="http://www.jonesbikes.com/">Jones</a> 3D Spaceframe bike. That took the rest of 2008. Saving money, making decisions, finally ordering, waiting for it to be crafted, then the build itself. And it's been awesome. But it wasn't a replacement for the previous idea, and I hoped to one day get back to it...</p>

<p>A few weeks ago the original frame that started all of this was put up for sale. Actually a "rolling chassis" as the industry says, with wheels (2 sets actually) a fork, custom stem, Bontrager seat post, and King bottle cages... all for about the money I had saved. I considered for a few moments, but knew that if I wanted a chance I had to move. So I called Lisa, sent an email to the owner, and was first in line. I checked size, looked over pictures and drawings (it is a custom frame) -- things looked good. And here we are with a chassis to build up. It's based on the MootoX YBB, and after dropping a few parts on for test, it seems very close in the one measurement I was concerned with to the bike I ride the most. Sweet.</p>

<p>My LBS is closed for vacation so I can't order the build until they're back. Since I wait, you wait. The next installment will provide some more back story about the guy I got this from and his exploits, and then more about what makes this bike unique, and then we'll finish up with the build. Allez!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:center;"><p>When most people think of snow and bikes it looks like this:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31941383@N00/385014824"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/131/385014824_f7464c7f68.jpg" style="margin:9px;"></a><br>Or maybe even as below for some very dedicated folks who love biking and winter.<br>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77945684@N00/403395999"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/174/403395999_e9149e6287.jpg" style="margin:9px;"></a></p>
<p>But for Mike Curiak, it looks like this:</p>
<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/snxc-006e.jpg" alt="snxc 006e.jpg" border="0" width="500" height="364" /></div>

<p>There's a lot about this very special bike that you can't know from first glance. For example, the frame tubes attach to a "gas can" to fuel a stove. You can see the "tank" with the Moots gator on it over the cranks. Lots of other cool stuff. Why? Because Mike doesn't just go for a ride in the snow. <a href="http://forums.mtbr.com/showthread.php?t=267649">Mike is a legend in endurance biking circles.</a></p>

<blockquote>He has competed in the Iditabike for the past 10 years, winning the 350 mile version once and the 1,100 mile race twice. He holds the course record for the northern route (the race alternates between two different routes every year). He also holds the record for the Great Divide Race from Canada to Mexico along the Continental Divide. Until last year, he was the record-holder for the Kokepelli Trail Race, pedaling between Moab and Grand Junction in just under 14 hours.</blockquote>

<p>Back in 2007 of the <a href="http://www.alaskaultrasport.com/alaska_ultra_home_page.html">Iditarod Train Invitational</a> he said "Last year was brutal — the highest temperature I saw during the entire race was 26 below." High of 26 below? Hmmm. That takes preparation. This isn't the time to discuss unsupported wilderness adventure, backwoods riding, or long distance riding. Suffice it to say that Mike knows a thing or two about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/3837350">Here's a video of his tour of the Iditarod Trail, Knik Lake to McGrath in early March 2009.</a> and ova heya is <a href="http://lacemine29.blogspot.com/2008/02/snowbike-timeline.html">timeline of his snow bikes</a> and their evolution so far. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[An aside: Eric Parsons designs and sews the gear you see on the snow bikes. Eric adventures pretty hard as well but when not he runs <a href="http://www.epicdesignsalaska.com/">Epic Designs</a>. You can custom order stuff with measurements, or go with stock stuff, or design whatever you need for your adventures. I haven;t ordered from Eric, although we've talked about a few things. Another excellent choice is Jeff Boatman's <a href="http://www.carouseldesignworks.com/main.html">Carousel Design Works</a>. I have one of Jeff's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carouseldesignworks/3666941699/sizes/l/">Escape Pods</a>. Bomb proof. One of the great features of all three gents is that the designs are informed by doing. In their own adventures they depend on the stuff they design and in the cases of the bags sew and build. Rubber to the road people, rubber to the road.]</cite></p>

<p>And while he doesn't sew bags when he's not out adventuring <a href="http://lacemine29.blogspot.com/">Mike</a> runs a shop called <a href="http://www.lacemine29.com/">Big Wheels</a> where he specializes in hand built wheels for your 29er. He's thorough, has no need to build "boutique" wheels to help you spend money (but can if you wish), and will recommend rims, hubs, spokes that match what you tell him about your riding, what you plan for the wheels, your weight etc. Go order a set. You'll be happy as a clam I tell you what.</p>

<p>You might <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2010/01/13/anticipation-arrival/">recall</a> that I said I was perusing someone's blog and they started posting pictures of a new bike they built. So clearly that person was Mike. And it actually starts a bit further back than that. The bike was delivered<a href="http://lacemine29.blogspot.com/2007/11/anticipation-satiety.html"> on Friday Nov. 2nd 2007</a>. And the first ride pics the <a href="http://lacemine29.blogspot.com/2007/11/stunning-fall-weather-continues-and-i.html">following Tuesday.</a> But those pics weren't really enough to peak my attention. The pictures of the built bike however inspired me to write to Mike and ask some questions. That was in February. And it wasn't too much longer before there were <a href="http://lacemine29.blogspot.com/2008/10/fading-away.html">ride pictures.</a> Oh my.</p>

<p>So this frame sits in a work stand ready to be built. I have two sets of Mike's wheels and a set of Billy's wheels to choose from (at the moment they're rubbered as fat, middle, road). Next week I'll order the missing parts and get busy. That'll be the next installment.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/cPsQgBR08vkrjfCGVmq_bg?authkey=qn8SFngrhd8"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/mfrd-017c.jpg" alt="mfrd 017c.jpg" border="0" width="400" height="280" /></a></div>


<p>Lastly, since many of you do ride in the winter, and a common discussion is cold feet and footwear. Have a look at what Mike's system: <a href="http://lacemine29.blogspot.com/2007/11/warm-feet-are-happy-feet_17.html">Warm feet are happy feet</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>...cause the weather looks like this:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/weather_storm.png" alt="weather_storm.png" border="0" width="362" height="229" /></div>

<p>But I managed before it started sleeting/frozen raining. I try and do some sort of epic ride every year around my birthday. I used to try and do it on my birthday, but that's almost never possible somehow. But it doesn't matter because it seems like no matter what day works out, the weather does not cooperate. It has been extremely cold, sleeting, snowing, or some combination of all three. So the epic part has been less about miles and more about just getting out there in this nastiness. So today, by going early I traded cold for frozen rain.  Feels like a fair trade. It was about freezing when I went, all layered up. Since I has just put a new seatpost and saddle on the Salsa I took it around the corner to make sure things were good. Saddle was good, but I adjusted a cleat and added a layer. Uphill was fine, but downhill was leaking through.</p>

<p>Suitably protected <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark"><blockquote>[On top, Merino wool base, mid weight poly, waffle weave jersey, Rapha Winter Jersey and Lightweight Softshell (I could really use the regular one, but alas, I can't afford it) and a Pearl Izumi jacket over that. I had a winter wool cap on, and a Winter Collar to pull up over my mouth and nose on the downhills. Half lobster gloves. On the bottom was Mad Alchemy embro and a single winter weight long bibs. Lake winter boots, no special socks (well, they're cool white with red polka dots, but not winter weight and you couldn't see them anyway. I went with circulation over insulation in the warm Lake boots.]</blockquote></cite> <br>I made my way to the hills and started climbing. I love the quiet that days like this have. It's Sunday, it's early, the weather looks threatening, most sane people are pulling covers over their heads. Who's out? Some folks running in loose sweats, a pack of cyclists going in the other direction with their clear rain capes on (they looked cold...) and couple of people looking miserable while walking their dogs.</p>

<p>So yeah, it was quiet. And I love that. You can hear all the forest land interactions. Skittering of little things collecting food. Birds dropping portions of whatever from the trees. The occasional snap of a twig under a hoof. And the superbly quiet whirring of a tuned drivetrain.</p>

<p>I rolled up past this one incredibly sized mansion. Past the closed summer camp perched on the side of the hill. Up the final steep pitch and past a group of guys who looked like they were about to go hiking and were in the middle of the pre hike joshin' and jokin' around. Finally deeper in the park and the quiet is near complete. The lakes were frozen and the gravel roads frozen and fun to ride.</p>

<p>I didn't feel like rolling all the way around, the back half of this ride is less pretty, so rode out to the Church in the Woods and turned around. What a lovely ride to start the year.</p>

<p>This bike has been with me for a while but in a few incarnations. I've used it as a commuter built as a single speed on the mean streets of the City. Recently when I rebuilt my "summer" bike I moved the old parts here. I've been using it on the trainer and rollers, and for some of these messy rides. It bears the brunt of the worst weather, my most tired riding, and the indignity of the rollers... all with a bike like smile. It's smooth, and more than stiff enough, comfortable, and pleasant. It complains about nothing except... when I really step on it going uphill I can wrench the rear tire askew in the dropouts. No matter how I clamp the wheel I seem to be able to do it, and since it happens at the worst possible moment (going up a steep uphill is not the time for what feels like a some serious braking with a preceding rise in gear if I don't do it all at once.) I'll have to work on that problem. All else is really lovely.</p>

<p>The frozen lake, although I wouldn't walk out there at the moment.</p>

<p>The previous snow is almost gone.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4282391116/" title="Salsa Casseroll by linkwright, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/4282391116_d8464ecc59.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Salsa Casseroll" /></a>

<p>The Salsa Casseroll does yeoman's duty during the wet winter months. I normally have fatter tires on there, but I was too lazy this morning to change out the wheels. Besides, these guys have been getting the brunt of the roller sessions. I feel like I owed them some fresh air and gravel.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4281648357/" title="View across handlebars by linkwright, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4028/4281648357_159770f329.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="View across handlebars" /></a>

<p>Haven't used 3T stuff before. This stem is not too expensive, not heavy. (6 degree, 100)</p>

<p>I got a Bontrager seatpost with the Moots Monster Cross. I had this Fizik Antares saddle waiting in the wings for the Moots, but I dropped the combo on here because Aliantes have been less comfortable than they once were. I wouldn't mind a smidge more padding, but the Antares are working better, and the post saddle combo was lighter to boot. I'll Ebay stuff this week.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4281648671/" title="Church gets new slate roof by linkwright, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2451/4281648671_af5b164243.jpg" width="500" height="188" alt="Church gets new slate roof" /></a>

<p>The Old Church in the Woods which never seems that active but is clearly getting fresh new slates and copper flashing. Shows what I know. Slate roofs look amazing, and cared for, can last 100 years or so. My kind of conservation.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That's my opinion of the weather. Gray, wet, cold... nasty. Upside of getting out? I chatted with a nice guy on <a href="http://www.richardsachs.com/rsachs2.html">Richard Sachs</a> road bike. Classic Sachs color and "atmo". The guy passed me pleasantly enough, but I called out "Richard Sachs? You bastard!" with a big smile on my face. It caused him to slow up, and we chatted for a few miles until I turned around. Nice. I also saw a <a href="http://www.waltworks.com/dev/index.php">Waltworks</a> the other day. The new Niner carbon fork, fronting some nice black painted steel. Super clean build. Midwinter riding is bringing out some people and stuff. I'm still my old self however, because I got the name of neither fellow.</p>

<p>I did have some biker trash fun today though. One of the set of wheels I got with the frame (that I *still* have not built) was a pair of Zipp 505 clincher rims laced to a set of ISO disc DT Swiss 240 mountain hubs. Since they don't have discs on them yet, I had no issue throwing them on the 'Roll for fun. I got the usual biker snob looks of disdain running aero Zipps in midwinter on a steel bike, but that sort of thing just makes me smile. Some folks don't know how little style they have.</p>

<p>Lack of cooperation displayed below... sigh. Allez!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The can't help themselves. Even when they're bashing Apple they praise Apple. From "<a href="http://windows7news.com/2010/01/28/why-the-ipad-will-fail-and-help-windows-7-to-succeed/">Why the iPad will fail and help Windows 7 to succeed.</a>"</p>

<blockquote>Firstly this new type of device, obviously based on something that’s been around since 2002 but we’ll skip lightly over that one, is a very interesting form-factor that, now popularised will enable just about everybody to produce a clone tablet.</blockquote>

<p>So now that Apple has shown everyone how it should be done, they'll be able to clone the device and stick Win 7 on it? That's exactly what hasn't been working since 2002 that you skipped so lightly over. Next! BTW, It would appear that "popularised" is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=popularised&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">misspelled</a>. Maybe that's a Win7 bug? Heh. Just funnin ya'll.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not that long a go a "workstation" implied an integrated effort. Hardware and Operating System engineered by the same company which ensured a more seamless experience. There have been many companies that have produced these integrated efforts including Sun and Apple.</p>

<p>Certainly the out of box experience of Lisa's iMac was exceptional The unit was unboxed. The power cord was attached to the back and the wall. The power button was pushed. The computer suggested putting the batteries in to the wireless mouse and keyboard and connected them to the system when that was complete, and a few clicks later Lisa was ready to get to work. One wire. If only Shipstone existed outside of Heinlein books.</p>

<p>That experience, as great as it is diminishes over time. Why? Because after all that is over, it's still a computer. You have apps to install, files in a file system, bookmarks in multiple browsers etc. Essentially, all the baggage of computing that has accrued over the last 25 years or so.</p>

<p>The iPad is yet another step along the path of washing all that away. Many of us are used to a near continuous connection to the nets. Many of us have storage "in the cloud" that makes our work available where ever, whenever. The IPad hides the OS, it hides the file system, it hides the computer. It make software as much of an appliance as the hardware has become. It seems, while you use it, do only do one thing. As if at that moment it's nothing more than a email device. Or a "todo" list. Or a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Once again it's about simplicity. It's about making choices as a designer, having an opinion about what's needed, for whom and when. Will it be all things to all people? Of course, not. But it could well be a device for many people for much of the time. And easier and more convenient to use than a laptop or desktop computer. We'll see.</p>

		<title>Frosthaven near Harriman</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://books.simonandschuster.com/Frost-Bites/Charles-Ogden/Edgar-Ellen-Nodyssey/9781416954644">book we're reading to Noah</a> the characters get blown in a balloon to an arctic town called Frosthaven. It's become a metaphor for my winter riding. The residents of Frosthaven are most proud of their ice sculptures. 'Round here, where proud to not let the winter prevent us from enjoying the outdoors, though it takes some preparation. Long live the Frosthaven Winter's Day rides.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/screen-shot-2010-02-07-at-12-31-21-pm.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-02-07 at 12.31.21 PM.png" border="0" width="293" height="155" /></div>

<p>Above is not a graphic of my speed (sadly), but the wind speed. Ouch. But it was a bright sunny day to be enjoyed as much as possible. We were lucky and the snow storm that covered the mid atlantic states in 2 feet of snow stayed south of us and here it's sunny and bright. So despite the 18 degree temps it was a day to ride. And because it's been fairly dry around here, I thought heck, I'd take the carbon rocket out for its first spin with its new parts.</p>

<p>I picked a route with the maximum amount of uphill for the distance (climbing equals warmth) and pulled on a merino base layer, two mid layers, a winter jersey, and a jacket. On my head was a windblocking beanie, the hood from the top midlayer, and a winter collar that I could pull up. Long winter bibs were covered by winter tights. Not a bad mix considering the conditions.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/img_1582.jpg" alt="IMG_1582.jpg" border="0" width="640"></div>

<div style="text-align:center;margin-top:17px;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/img_1584.jpg" alt="IMG_1584.jpg" border="0" width="640" height="360" /></div>


<p>First new part was the <a href="http://bythehive.com/collection/revl/">Revl carbon brakes</a> by <a href="http://bythehive.com/">theHive</a>. They turned out to be really nice. They're light but feel solid and produced well modulated stops. They look spiffy too. Look how nice and salted up I got them already! (Oy, where's that rag...). </p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/img_1576.jpg" alt="IMG_1576.jpg" border="0" width="436" height="640" /></div>

<p>And key here is that they fit nicely on the wide rims of the <a href="http://www.hedcycling.com/wheels/ardennes_c2.asp">Hed Ardennes</a>.</p>

<p> I predicted that wide rims would rule the minute I rode them. Now,  besides the wide rims made for mountain bikes, and of course the four levels of wheel from Hed (Ardennes, Bastogne, Kermess, and the top of the line Flamme Rouge version of the Ardennes with ceramic bearings, titanium spokes etc.) <a href="http://velocityusa.blogspot.com/2010/01/hello-proto.html">Velocity is testing the A23 wide rim</a>, and some new hubs to go with. Looking forward to trying those out. Zipp has widened a number of their rims as well. I tell you what, them wide rims sure ride purty right there. Truly they do.</p>

<p>Another change was the <a href="http://www.edgecomposites.com/forks/road.aspx">front fork to an Edge 1.0</a>. It's wonderfully smooth and plenty stiff enough, and of course more than light enough. I like the flat look and quiet graphics, something I wish the industry as a whole would embrace. Imagine if everyone drove around in cars that looked like they're Nascar equivalents. Essentially, that's what many of us are forced to do. (I know some do it by choice, that's fine, but I'd rather not.)</p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/img_1575.jpg" alt="IMG_1575.jpg" border="0" width="571" height="374" /></div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:17px;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/img_1577.jpg" alt="IMG_1577.jpg" border="0" width="640" height="360" /></div>

<p>The hill pain was acceptable, the ride shorter than I had wanted because the wind was pushing me all over the road. On one laughingly sad uphill section the wind forced me out of the saddle because the road was already at 11 percent, it basically blew me to a stop, and had it lasted any longer would've forced me to dismount. That blast changed my mind about continuing, and took the first exit off the mountain and headed home glad I got out for over an hour.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/img_1602.jpg" alt="sittin in the snow fort" border="0" width="640" height="359" /></div>

<p>After completing a very long haul for work, I had to cover Noah's winter break. There's only so many days Lisa can take off after all. And while watching Noah can be tiring (he doesn't stop moving), it's also an enormous joy that I do not partake of enough. Every day I make a choice... sometimes many times a day, to finish up something for work, or play with him, to take care of a chore or read him a story, etc. I do not always make the right choice. I try to, but I fail. But this day I could do right, and while the baby sitter was an option, I really wasn't interested in missing this opportunity to take care of some chores that would wait for some other time.</p>

<p>Noah was sitting in the snow fort we built. Snow fort building followed sledding, which followed snowman construction, and inscribing a heart on the base of the snowman for mommy when she got home from work.</p>

<p>There was also the requisite snow ball fight, and general rolling around in the copious piles of snow.</p>

<p>Everything was awesome until in one blinding second I realized I had lost my wedding ring. This was not one of those where did I leave it deals. I *knew* it was gone the minute looked at my hand. I ran back outside, but saw it nowhere, and there where no telltale holes or indications as to where it might have gone. It was very upsetting.</p>

<p>I'm not so foolish as to believe that the ring is anything more than symbol. Lisa is equally clear about this. The rings change nothing. I didn't even get married with this ring. I purchased rings for Lisa (with her, I guess I should say), and my family passed on a wedding band from Mother's mother to her. I received a similar gift of a wedding band from her family. But we put off buying me a ring. I don't recall why. Expense? Sure. Uncertain of what I wanted? Nah. I knew exactly what I wanted. I don't recall, but clearly the time wasn't right, and waiting would fill. It always does. It is the pattern of our lives together.</p>

<p>Roughly two years later we stopped into a jeweler to have something fixed, and there it was. The ring I desired, in my size, and on clearance (I never knew this happened to things like wedding bands, but I guess even the timeless styles have their moments.) I had my ring. More recently, we've considering what to do since I've lost quiet a bit of weight and the ring is now loose most of the time. Especially in the cold. And a glove can pull it right off. See another pattern developing?</p>

<p>I had pulled my gloves off a bunch of times while playing with Noah. I'm usually fairly aware of my ring during these "transitional" moments. But one of those times, I had clearly missed my ring pulling loose. And now it was gone—lost in  three foot piles of snow.</p>

<p>I looked a few more times but found nothing. All that was left besides moping around was telling Lisa, who said "Don't worry. We'll find it." I thought she was trying to make me feel better, but having looked fairly carefully by that point I was confident that it was gone. It would melt into the ground and then get flung by the gardeners to heaven knows where with the mowers and blowers.</p>

<p>A coworker of Lisa's owns a metal detector. Lisa arranged to borrow it and went to fetch it today. We place her ring on the driveway to get some sense of what it would sound like, and I hoped that there wouldn't be too many screws and nails swept off the driveway to make this a silly quest. I started where I thought it had fallen and got a quick hit. I dug up the snow down to the grass and went through it finding nothing. This could be a long day. I checked another long section around the snowman, and a place where I know I had put my gloves. Nada. I couldn't believe I would have lost it further along by the fort, because I built the fort with my gloves on (as I recall. Who knows at this point). The lack of false positives made me more hopeful. So I continued. And there in the front of the fort on the inside was a chirp. I needed sharper shovel especially if I was going to get down to the grass, the fort had frozen fairly solid in the last two days.</p>

<p>I got the gardening shovel out of the garage, and with Lisa spotting grabbed the whole section down to the grass and spread it out on the now snow free driveway. I went through a bunch of clumps without finding anything, and I was beginning to be very wary of finding anything. But I was going to go through every clump... I broke open another clump and there it was! Yes! Some things are meant to be.</p>

<p><img src="http://jhische.com/dailydropcap/V-4-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" align="left">alentines day is not much of a deal around here. Lots of reasons, but if nothing else I don't need the retail and card industries telling me when to appreciate my wife, nor how. Still, it makes a nice story... Ya remember back in 2010 when I... You can almost see my most doddering old self from here. Frankly, it's not that far away.</p>

<p>On an entirely different topic... my latest bike build has started. It's been taking a while since figuring out the parts took longer than I expected and some parts are still being anodized. But a few parts have made it to the bike including the 36-11 SRAM XX cassette, rear der. and the BB7 brakes. It's going to be fairly spectacular... if it works. Time will tell. Prolly be another week or so.</p>

I was reading the whole time thinking I would get you a metal detector and spend all day looking for it, what an adventure!  I'm glad you found it.  Reminds me of the time I lost my engagement ring at Gerry's beach house only to have it turn up on the couch weeks later (the work of ghosts, clearly).  

What are you having anodized?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I never think it's going to take as long as it does. A warning sign for estimation of any sort. A <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2010/01/15/frame-source/">while back</a> I wrote about used frame and starting a build. That was back in January, and here it is March, and other than the parking lot shakedown, the bike is untested. It was finally completed late yesterday.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mike is off to his <a href="http://lacemine29.blogspot.com/2010/02/touring-alaska-2010.html">latest adventure</a>. You can follow along on his <a href="http://lacemine29.blogspot.com/">blog</a> (guest blogging by <a href="http://arcticglass.blogspot.com/">Jill Homer</a>).</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/-KdzJuh2JoF0kANjMi15Lw?authkey=Gv1sRgCN-LrsHnwsS_qgE&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/akm-475se.jpg" alt="akm 475se.jpg" border="0" width="800" height="551" /></a></div>

<p>Anyway... so the idea of the build was to make this frame fill in between the full on fat tired mountain goat of my <a href="http://jonesbikes.com/blog">Jeff Jones</a> and the commute/road bikes of the Casseroll and R3SL. I was looking for great versatility, a bit of the goat, but also the ability to crank it out on the road. I wanted it to feel comfortable on gravel or off road, but not feel upright and overmatched on the road. We'll see if I managed all that. Compromise is a compromise all it's own.</p>

<p>Things that went wrong. I made some assumptions about what would and not fit on the frame, Specifically the crankset. A compact road integrated spindle was not going to go, the stays are too wide. But I wanted to put drop bars (or alt drop bars) on this build. Makes the road thing work sooo much better. Offroad, I seem to like alt bars, like the h-bar on my Jones, or as I first expected, Midge bars on this bike. And I wanted to use integrated road shifters. If wasn't going to get thedorp bars and integrated shifters on here, for the type of riding I have available to me, this frame was not going to work. I should add, that I need enough top end to keep up with my road bike riding friends, and enough bottom end to climb off road without wrecking my knees.</p>

<p>So looking at what would fit, and what I wanted we started making some hard choices. Short of playing around with spindle length and really experimenting (read costly in time and money) the simplest thing to do was to go with a triple. I looked at what was out there, found a crank I would have really loved to try (it seemed to fulfill the triple dream of light, strong, and inexpensive) but my LBS couldn't get it, and I wasn't going to spend any non-ebay money/credit. So I went with the classic XTR cranks, which if things didn't work out, would at least provide excellent return when sold. We left the little 22 ring off, which gave me a 44 and 32 up front. The 44 top end concerned me a bit, but I rarely spin a 50x11 combo so it seemed that a 44x11 might hang in there. I can always get a 48 tooth ring on there, that'll certainly cover me, but I'm going to try this first.</p>

<p>These cranks also gave me the chance to use a Chris King bottom bracket, which already has an great reputation. They are incredibly smooth. That much I can already feel. And they add a touch more color.</p>

<p>Next was what to use as a front der. Bill picked out on the new SRAM XX front der from the zillions of variations they make. He seemed confident. I trust him. It seems to have worked out just fine.</p>

<p>Out back I matched up the new Sram XX ten speed stuff. Works perfectly with their integrated shifters, and the 36/11 cassette back there gives some nice range to the gearing from a low of 32x36 to a high of 44x11.</p>

<p>Once the cranks and stuff were on I spent some time trying out the custom Moots stem and Midge bars vs. a Thomson stem and 3T road drop bars that were on the shelf.  Both were comfortable so for this round I went with the road bars because of an upcoming ride. 4000ft. of climbing, 25% dirt, I'm hoping that this bike will split the difference nicely. We'll see once I done some real riding on it, and it will partly depend on the weather (choice of tires and bike).</p>

<p>Everything else are routine choices. Avid BB7 160/140 discs, a Chris King Dreadset (nice! a few bucks to <a href="http://chrisking.com/store/w4l2007">Wheels4Life</a> and the bike needed a little color.) I have three sets of wheels for the frame, two built <a href="http://www.lacemine29.com/">by Mike</a>. One set needs different rotors, there's some mismatch between the center locks on there and the BB7s. I'll look in to that shortly. Then there are Zipp 505s laced to DT Swiss 240s. They're road wheels in both the aero and rubber categories. Lastly are wheels that Billy built for me, Red CK hubs drilled 32, laced 3 cross to Mavic rims. They have 35c cross tires spun on. I'll prolly change the rubber, but I'm not sure to what yet. In the meantime they're just fine.</p>

<p>Gore Ride On cables, Red shifters, King Ti cages, Salsa QRs. Crank Brothers eggbeaters, Fizik Gobi saddle and Cyrano post complete the touch points. I have a seat pack from Carousel Designworks that'll work fine, and I hope to order a frame bag for my own adventures.</p>

<p>I have no nice pics yet as the build was finished late yesterday.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4396891284/" title="IMG_1764 by linkwright, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2683/4396891284_426ba489ec.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="IMG_1764" /></a></div>

<p>Yeah, there's no question that this build from the frame and fork to the various components is a bit out of the box. But that's OK. No need to fret. Everything's gonna be just fine. And seems in character with the original owner, my own sense of adventure, and a willingness to learn what works and what doesn't for me.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I've got Battenkill in a week, and I have very few miles in my legs. Getting out today was imperative. The problem was the crazy huge rain storm we've been experiencing. High winds, pouring rain, lightning, thunder, flooding from both the rain on top of the snow melt and saturated ground. It's quite biblical overall.</p>

<p>But there's gonna be a lot of riding to do next week and taking two weeks off seemed like the wrong approach. I prepped last night, getting crud catcher and fender in place. I made sure there was a rear light and that headlamps were charged. I found clothes that seemed like they'd keep me warm and somewhat dry.</p>

<p>In what appeared to be a break in the weather I set out on the Moots. The break lasted about five minutes. But no matter, I was prepared (Ha! That was my attempt at foreshadowing). I headed off toward Harriman for the some climbing, and things were going well until the road turns toward the foothills. There's a car parked on the side of the road, and someone standing in the middle of the road taking pictures. And the road was a mess of gravel based "sand bars" left from the flooding. I slowed and picked and my way through. And just when I thought things were cool I see the "river" that now has reclaimed the road. I looked for a shallow spot, and didn't find much. I dismounted, found the best section I could and stepped. I got only half a boot full of water. I was thinking that I was under prepped for today's ride at that point...</p>

<p>At least it wasn't freezing out, so I shook it off and pedaled off to start the climbing. Things were good for a while and I enjoyed the lower gearing this bike provides. Some of the tributaries were class five rapids but they're well drained and the mountain side is steep, so all was well with the roads at this point. I climbed up and over the hill, and felt like absolute crud. After cresting, things loosened up a tad, but not a lot. I start making my way around to turn for home and I'm heading down the first prolonged down grade. There's a hiker or runner on the side of the road sittin' on the guard rail talking to someone in a car. The car was naturally stopped in the middle of the road, and I soft pedaled to see whether this party was breaking up anytime soon. Naturally a second after I commit to going around the car they decide to move along. I grabbed two hands full of brake briefly forgetting that I have discs on the Moots. It kindly reminded me by locking up the rear wheel until I eased off... in the meantime my flashing and very bright headlamps caught the eye of the driver in his rear view, and he eased up before any real damage was done.</p>

<p>Out on Route 17 things were progressing apace, and I was trying to decide how hard The Transition would be. The Transition is where the cars peel off Route 17 onto I287. It's often annoying and sometimes dangerous to continue going straight, when so many cars want to pass you on the left and then head off to the right.</p>

<p>Even as I was considering all this I see two marked cars with lights going. Uh oh. Sure 'nuff the road is closed. Folks are turning around or being shunted off into New Jersey. I pedaled up to the first cop, and asked "Wires down?" "Nah, road flooded, but you can ride through if you want. What's the worst that can happen? You'll get wet?" Which was somewhat ironic considering how wet I already was, never mind the damp right foot from the river crossing. So on I pedaled hoping it wouldn't be too bad, and enjoying the rare opportunity to ride Route 17 free of cars.</p>

<p>It was bad. All four lanes covered in water. I tried to sneak through near the Jersey barriers, and when the water got high enough sort of pushed my way through with the pedals evened out, still both feet and the bike got a pretty good soaking. Further up the road I see the other closure, and another swimming pool. But this time the other side was clear. I lifted the bike over the Jersey Barrier and then vaulted over (Cross skills? Who knew). Back on the bike I ride the last closed section, chatting briefly with some folks who were looking for some fishing supplies from Davis Sports. They were walking up the road in the opposite direction. Sportsmen are an interesting breed, no matter the sport. (It occurs to me that I was kinda thinking, "These crazy guys are walking half a mile up the road in order to get some stuff, and then walk back here, get in their car and go fishing somewhere in this weather? Crazy" Of course, the irony that I was out riding 30 miles on a bike never crossed my mind. Such compartmentalization keeps me chugging in the right direction...)</p>

<p>As I wove my way past the road flare and cars blocking the road, the cop opens his window, leans out and exclaims "You are my hero!" with a big grin on his face. I smiled, accepted the "chapeau", and pedaled off with a wave.</p>

<p>Other than a few more minor river crossings, where I got more wet from the cars who couldn't manage not to splash me, by, oh, I dunno, waiting a second for me to pass, than the water I was passing through, the rest of the trip was uneventful. By now the common mix of rain, thunder, lightning and junk in the roads caused me no concern. The headwinds were as usual, annoying, and not helping me feel any better about my riding. But you can get used to anything it seems. Alas, I had nothing but heavy legs anyway... it is what it is.</p>

<p>But the ride was worth it. I feel like I worked out some of the kinks. I feel a bit more mentally prepped for next week. And there's nothing like "suffering" for one's art. I don't recommend it, but there's nothing like it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4453388585/" title="The road by linkwright, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4052/4453388585_2fbe6cca74.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="The road" /></a></div>

<p>We were going slowly. Seriously slowly. So slowly that folks that started long after us passed us before long. So slowly that The Sweep could've been our personal team car. Jenni was *not* feeling well, and it showed. Yes, she was happy to be there (as was I) but she could muster none of what I've come to know as Jenni's riding style. Normally she has a unique blend of pushing her own limits and knowing when to enjoy her surroundings. It's one of the things that makes it fun to ride with her. Today she had nothing; her heart was racing. We knew that going in (that she'd been struggling with her heart), but what we didn't know is exactly how hard the course was, the other variables that go into a ride, and how she'd be feeling this day.</p>

<p>We loped along by ourselves enjoying the scenery—which is quite spectacular. Hills, rolling farm land, horses, cows (The Belted Galloway or the Dutch Belted, also known as "Panda cows"), goats, dogs, roosters, chickens, fields waking up from a winter's sleep, coniferous forest, and lots of pleasant folks doing chores. We inched our way up the super steep inclines, bombed the downhills, and settled into our own, personal, groupetto.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4453389127/" title="The dirt by linkwright, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2707/4453389127_7827b1560b.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="The dirt" /></a></div>

<p>A huge part of what made the day possible was Wil. He came along and drove the course with us giving us the near equivalent of a team car. He didn't literally drive right behind us, but he was never too far, and it made it easier to ditch bottles, have nourishment with us -- in fact we never made to an "open" feed station. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4454169828/" title="Wil, team car captain, map in hand by linkwright, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2704/4454169828_83614174c2_m.jpg" width="240" height="135" alt="Wil, team car captain, map in hand" align="right" /></a>They had essentially packed up each time before we got there. A special thank you to him for devoting his entire day (driving 3 hours up there, then the 62+ miles of the course, at bike speed essentially, and then driving back for 3 more hours).</p>

<p>My part in this little saga was that I pulled and pulled and pulled through a metric ton of headwind. As I said earlier, Jenni was not feeling well. So I got out in front, and stayed there, boring a hole in the wind. As a tickling annoyance Ivan said that when we hit that stretch there'd be a tailwind, complete with a "let's see, the wind is coming from thataway, and you'll be turning thisaway so it'll be a tailwind, which is good because that stretch is flat and boring". Yeah, OK. Whatever. Jenni commented later that she didn't notice the headwinds. That put a proud smirk on my face. (As an added bonus, when you look at the elevation chart, find the flat section... I'm still looking for it). I did make a bad choice of saddle on the day, and from about mile 1.5 a saddle sore got more and more painful. All the seated climbing, the pace, etc. helped annoy it until at mile 40ish I decided I was not having fun anymore. I wasn't cooked or anything, but every stroke hurt, and the pain had grown wearying. But that's when it got interesting. (Further proof that I wasn't cooked—I'm not sore today at all. No weak legs. None of the symptoms of "blasted" that I've experienced before.)</p><div style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4454162856/" title="Lonely looking, ain't I? by linkwright, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4044/4454162856_8ab968b5de_m.jpg" width="240" height="226" alt="Lonely looking, ain't I?" /></a></div>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4453385125/" title="Jenni passing a farm by linkwright, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4021/4453385125_e02439016d_m.jpg" width="240" height="135" alt="Jenni passing a farm" /></a>

<p>Jenni's insides had started to awaken. She was feeling like she could finish the route. She had clawed her way up the first two steeps and there was one more left, and she was determined to finish now that she was feeling better. So while I drank chocolate milk and climbed into the car, she continued on. Naturally, the first thing she did was ride off the course. It was classic. So we turned around and made sure she was back, and then moved up the road a bit.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4454168980/" title="Jenni's epic by linkwright, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4454168980_a4f66ea969.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="Jenni's epic" align="right" /></a>

<p>Considering how she had ridden all day, I kept telling Wil to stop and wait, which naturally annoyed Jenni, so after her "suggesting" otherwise we switched to 5 mile intervals... she climbed up and over the hill that most folks complained about which was a looser sort of gravel than the previous stuff. I was thinking about the road conditions as we drove it but my choco-delirium prevented me from acting. I should've gotten out and made sure she was riding this collection of marbles well. The Moots was sporting relatively fat 27c tires which would have made it easier for me, but the plan was to meet her just ahead. We pulled over shortly, I got out, climbed back on my bike and rolled back down a short section to meet her on the last section of the loose gravel.</p>

<p>She arrived shortly, cussing about the climb and the decent, picking her way carefully over the tumbling gravel. Once we reached the pavement I could tell that she had ridden herself back. She was tired and flushed looking, but she was riding like herself. And as we completed the last 5 or so miles together I realized how magnificent a ride I had witnessed.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4454167992/" title="Dead tractor farm by linkwright, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4067/4454167992_224a6b62fa.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="Dead tractor farm" align="left"></a>

<p>A lot is written about suffering on a bike, and there's as many types of that as there are riders and roads. But this road was tough. As tough a ride as you could want. 18% grades on gravel roads (at least, that's the number I saw swimming before my eyes), stair step climbs that mess with your head, and steep climbs with loose gravel combined with a unique relentlessness. And being so far off the back that the desk called wondering whether we had 'forgotten to check in when we "left the course" since they were closing up' gives you some idea of where we were at all day long. But it didn't matter. She was determined to finish what she started that morning, and did so with no lesser glory for the empty lot that greeted us.</p>

<p>It was as magnificent a ride as any I've taken part in. My not finishing was not a big deal to me, those 17 miles didn't represent my goal for the day except most peripherally. Jenni made the Battenkill Preview Ride 2010 a monument to the strength, beauty, and grace that makes cycling so incredible (and yet still a literal pain in my ass).</p>

<p>The ride is great, the volunteers, sweepers etc, were all genuine, concerned, and helpful. The course map sucked, and the placement of things like the first feed station was off by some significant mileage. I had hoped that more "folks" would be there for the ride, but it was really mostly racers who were previewing the course for the races, and so there was a lot of team kit, ass checking, bike checking and the like. Would I do it again? Sure. But I got what I wanted out of this ride and lots more, and there's lots of other rides to take on... so who knows. But it would be fun to go again.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://epicmoonflower.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/tour-of-the-battenkill-2010-spring-preview-ride/">Jenni's ride report</a> for more pictures and her own elation. Chapeau to the Cardiac Kid. That was brilliant!</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks, but it wasn't really that hard (except for the steeps). Most of the rest was pretty standard stuff. What made it epic was the pace we were keeping, how Jenni felt, and how she turned it around. (To take nothing away from her effort)

If I were to do it again, I would take my other bike, put the big cassette on it, and not worry about the dirt and gravel (unless it had been pouring etc.). Maybe use 32 spoke wheels.

It's a great ride, and something anyone cycling in our area should do at some point.]]></wp:comment_content>

<p>I've had a very hectic spring. First there was grand jury duty 3 days a week for a month. Battenkill was next with my  attempts to get some miles in, finish the Moots build and the glorious ride itself. Then Passover hit like a ton of bricks. Cleaning, preparing, going away, coming back, having company, etc. Then back to work, full time, with the long commute, catching up on stuff I missed.</p>

<p>So, yeah, hectic. Joyous, glorious, wonderful! But hectic. And I had to prioritize and the blog took a hit. So it goes.</p>

<p>And now that things are settling back into a bit of rhythm, I take a moment to catch up here. So what's next?</p>

<p>I'm going to continue to work on filling the hole in the driveway, get the gutters repaired (this winter's huffing and puffing blew them off the house in places), I could well be riding the <a href="http://www.fatcyclist.com/2010/03/22/register-now-for-the-3rd-annual-100-miles-of-nowhere/">100 Miles of Nowhere</a> this Sunday, and be marshalling the 5 boro bike tour on the 2nd. I'm working on a top secret gift for Lisa that she knows all about (naturally), and Noah's on the verge of celebrating his 5th birthday.</p>

<p>Work got a bike parking program together and I'm trying to find ways to make use of it (starts too late, ends too early, and they strip all rights from anyone who signs up (you pay for damage to the building, overtime for the freight elevator operator, removal of your bike should you leave it overnight etc. etc. etc. all without any agreement baout how much and for what. Damn lawyers.) They've not made it easy, or friendly, but it's a start, and I hope to at least get some exercise out of it even if I can't use it to help my commute.</p>

<p>Noah has a garden he wants to plant, and I'm looking forward to getting everyone out into the sunshine. It's been a bit cool until late in the day, and we always have plenty to do, so it hasn't happened yet, but another few weeks should do it.</p>

<p>There's some longer term reviews I've been meaning to post about and some other stuff. So hopefully now that things are settling in, I'll get to them. See ya soon!</p>

<p>PS I ganked the picture from somewhere the other day, and now I can't find the person to credit them. If someone knows, get in touch!! Thanks.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/queensbo_bridge.jpg" alt="Queensbo_bridge.jpg" border="0" width="500" height="775" align="left" style="margin-right:9px;" />

<p>You'd think that the start of the <a href="http://www.bikenewyork.org/rides/fbbt/index.html">2010 Five Boro Bike Tour</a> with it's 32,000 entrants would look grandiose and wonderous. And you'd be mostly correct. But in actuality, for those of us who worked as marshalls (the helpful folks who line and ride the course) it actually looked like this:<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0508_2.jpg" alt="IMG_0508_2.jpg" border="0" width="120" height="160" align="right" style="margin-top:9px;" /></p>

<p>But I've already gotten ahead of myself. The day really started the night before, maybe not technically, but for me it certainly is the "night before" when I have to get up at 4:15am. And waking would've been harder if I ever fell asleep in the first place. But I got into one of those obsession cycles about various details of my planning and never got there.</p>

<p>No matter, I got up 15 minutes earlier than I had planned when I went to sleep,  and everything promptly took longer than I expected and I wound up leaving 15 minutes later than I planned. I hate that.</p>

<p>I did my standard commute, dragged the bike out of the car, threw my little bag over my shoulder and headed toward Times Square which of course, was recovering from an <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/05/03/2010-05-03_times_square_car_bomb_scare_how_events_unfolded.html">attempted bombing</a>. I rode down 7th, caught a little pave down by Varick, salmoned past the riders on Church getting to their fixed positions along the course and made my way to the castle in Battery Park. Signed in and found a quiet corner to begin waiting, the key element of the start of any large ride. </p>

<p>After briefings were given and materials handed out, our group headed out to a small park near the start to... wait for it... wait some more. We gave the waiting our full attention. Jamieson disappeared on some marshall related chore, only to reappear just before we started out. That was cool, although it set a pattern that was to repeat the entire day. One second he'd be ridin' with us, and the next second he'd be gone. After a long disappearance it turned out that he worked on two "medic" stops. He caught up with us as we worked with a Westpoint cadet on a flat tire after she crashed. She called me "Sir". I suggested she not call me that ("They tell us to") and added "Cadet, drop and give me 20..." Fortunately she laughed, because had she even begun the process, I would have been embarrassed beyond belief. Shortly after that he disappeared for the final time this ride...</p>

<p>Anyway after waiting so long that folks began to get know each other, the show got on the road. A <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/S-AwRV19KCI/AAAAAAAAOWI/5IOFhGKG3sU/s1600/pole+dancer+on+bike+2.JPG">stripper on a pole biked by</a> and so did the the hoards of cyclists of every kind and stripe. The folks reflected the City—there was a bit of everything.</p>

<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/bridge.jpg" alt="bridge.jpg" border="0" width="500" height="333" align="left" style="margin-right:9px;" />Two things stood out as bad amidst an extraordinary ride (for someone born and raised here, riding a bike on the FDR Drive, BQE, Gawanus Expr., Verrazano etc. is more than a little strange, and disheartening in that I rode many of the sections faster than I would traverse them in a car on the average trip...). One was the walking of Central Park. Too much congestion led to almost walking the entire park. It was not a pleasant stroll, though Jenni ran into a student from a recent bike class (unfortunately in need of help with a flat which we could not exactly provide due to equipment failures). The second was that onramp inclines led to large backups because people seemed intimidated by the ramps. Without even trying they would bounce off their bikes and start pushing as if there was no other choice. I think some encouragement might help.</p>

<p>Since I rode down from midtown and Jenni decided to join me for the trip home, we chose the West side cycle path to get back to the car. With that and other minor detours I rode a bit over 60 miles including the distance to the ferry in Staten Island. I can't comment on general food and services as I we didn't venture into the rest stops, this was not a particularly long ride for us and the sheer number of people at the stops was intimidating (Do you really want to wait that long for a banana?). We also didn't have to wait for a ferry—there was one there loading up when we got there.</p>

<p>A lot of folks asked me if I would do it again... and the answer is sure, if you give me a reason to do so. The ride is nice, the number of people involved stunning, but there's nothing so incredible that I would look to do it again. But if the right person asked, or Lisa wanted to do it, I'd happily go again. I'd hope for cooler weather (a decent chance most years) but other than that things were nice.</p>

<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/africangreyproblem.jpg" alt="Africangreyproblem.jpg" border="0" width="251" height="273" align="left" style="margin-right:9px;margin-bottom:9px;" />As you'll note from the back of this guy's shirt, traveling with a medium sized parrot has a downside on a trip like this. But he did get style points... I first saw him just before we stopped for a nature call, and then over and over again throughout the day. This happened with a few folks which I didn't expect because we did stop quite a few times to help folks. I would have thought that we'd be "off the back" of any particular group, but nope. We saw folks over and over again. Fun!</p>

<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0508_2.jpg" alt="IMG_0508_2.jpg" border="0" width="240" height="320" align="right" />So I talked about waiting? Here's what it looked like...</p>


<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/getting_started.jpg" alt="getting_started.jpg" border="0" width="500" height="223" />And then the start looked like this from the back... that's looking north toward the park...</p>

<p>For those of you who asked... I rode the MootoX, with 27c <a href="http://www.velo-orange.com/chpa70cl.html">Challenge Parigi Roubaix</a> tires, its YBB, and pedals for walkable mountain shoes. The walkable shoes were an especially good choice. Early in the morning while it was humid, it was cool and I wore arm warmers (Smartwool), knee warmers and a rain cape (both Rapha) over my jersey (Swobo). All of them were packed into the <a href="http://www.carouseldesignworks.com/main.html">Carousel Design Works</a> Escape Pod seat bag before we started riding (along with extra rubber gloves, plastic bags, and other "assistive" technology. I love that thing... I carried a tiny messenger style bag as well which was part pain and part joy. Yeah, I had to sling it around quite a bit, but it made access to paperwork, maps, food,  etc. organized and easy. I would have preferred a frame bag... but I haven't ordered one yet, and it might have been overkill (I didn't have that much to carry) but it would have put it where I wouldn't have to fuss as much. Toss up. I thought about finding a document bag and clipping it to the Pod, but I couldn't find anything lying around the house... but it would be something to consider for the next ride where I have that much stuff to carry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I passed out last night at about 9. Turned out to be long before Noah :)

Good thing too, because I forgot to set the alarm. As it was I woke up at my usual time with no problem... though I suspect it'll be another early night.

Kudos, BTW, to the folks who rode on Unicycles. That's a haul.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/idyllic_skating_scene_sp.jpg" alt="idyllic_skating_scene_sp.jpg" border="0" width="504" height="336" />

<p>A long time ago in a boyhood far, far away my parents taught me to skate. The scene would have looked a bit like the one above, only somewhat less idyllic. We got together with a friend of my mother's (the Fishman's) and in that classic arms forward stance (to keep your weight on your toes), I'm sure I stumbled all over the ice. Maybe one of the advantages of learning to skate on a lake rather than a rink, is it eliminates that awful starters parade of kids hanging onto the sideboards for dear life, shuffling slowly around the perimeter of the rink. There was no choice out there... if you wanted to move you had to figure out the skating thing. The skates were no doubt a Chanuka gift from my parents, and must have been just good enough. And while I have no specific recollection, I'm sure the swoopy, flying, gliding effect—that effortless forward motion caught me. From my current vantage point, it is easy to see why biking caught and stuck as well.</p>

<p>Jump forward a few years to a family friend (Stacie!) who had studied figure skating. Since I enjoyed skating, a party was planned that included going skating some Saturday night. As is common, halfway through the session the ice is cleared and the infamous Zamboni reset the ice. All slick, smooth, and wet. This being the 70's I'm dressed head to toe in light blue (just don't, OK?). Just after the ice is reopened it's "couples" time. Stacie grabs my hand and says "Let's go!" and before I could say a thing, I'm out on the ice being pulled along by the hand. I knew it was a mistake, but I was afraid to start skating, and I couldn't shake her loose. As our crowd of friends sees the two of us out there an "oooh" rises as a collective commentary on our holding hands, skating "together" (as if) and general tween teasing. Sure enough seconds later one of my blades catches on something, and I've now mopped up a nice swath of ice with the aforementioned light blue clothing that turned an instant navy blue... no hiding that error, either in that few of us were on the ice, or the darkened clinginess of my soaked clothing for quite some time after that. You'd think that would of have been it for me and skating... but the gliding speed always pulls me back.</p>

<p>In high school there was a small park and rink down the block. Skating sessions were one of the few nighttime activities that fit into the schedule, and where we could get permission to go. Combine that with the on again off again nature of the small ponds freezing and we had a winter's delight. A touch of freedom from oversight, a touch of freedom from gravity, and the odd whack at a puck with a stick... kinda playin' pick up hockey on the little ponds behind the rink. I can clearly remember hearing the booming cracks one January morning during the thaw.</p>
<img align="left" style="margin-right:13px;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/img_0510.jpg" alt="IMG_0510.JPG" border="0" width="400" height="300" />
<p>After high school skating sessions became far and few between. I was busy learning to be a musician and going to school. And while there might have been the occasional Saturday night skating deal, it certainly had no regularity. Kind of like my skiing "career", it all kinda went and died out with the focus on music and the lack of funds that went with that. But then... some friends were working at a bike shop and the winter keep busy deal there was hockey gear, skates, sharpening and the like. That winter they started playing pickup hockey over at Playland and before you know it they dragged me out, although I wasn't in a hockey mood. It was quite a show though. Sadly, I learned that my skates no longer fit me (they *really* hurt that last time...) so I stuffed them away, and the next time my sister asked I gave her my skates (she asked for one of her growing kids). I'm sure they're stored there somewhere (and worn on occasion I'd guess).</p>

<p>Since Noah been old enough we've tried to have him try all sorts of sports. He's been swimming, karate classes, obviously has been around bikes, trikes, etc., and now ice skating. And he really wants me out on the ice. And, of course, it appeals to me as well... so I went and found me some skates. Skates have changed quite a bit with lots of new tech, and even some changes in how people seem to approach wearing skates (thin socks now, not so much back then). Skates are often made of moldable material and are "baked" (200 degrees F for 4 minutes in my case) to soften them so that they mold themselves to your foot. And they are of course, lighter as you go up in price (and man can you get stratospheric if you care to). now I'm looking forward to playing with him on the ice. His teacher suggested a couple more weeks, which is cool, because it gives me a chance to get to a rink and glide off some cobwebs before that moment. One of the cool things about his teacher is that she was one of Lisa's babysitters and taught her how to skate as well. My chore will be getting her back out there. It would be nice to turn this into a family thing. Makes it far more fun...</p>

<p>A designer I've worked with in a couple of places plays hockey in a league. I wrote him note to see whether we can get together for some some getting started again tips, and help me clean up my technique a bit before I case harden some new bad habits. It would be fun just to hang with him... but skating would be really great.</p>

<p>Updates, as I get back to it... I wonder if <a href="http://feedalltheanimals.blogspot.com/">Chris</a> still skates?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rapidly changing weather makes for tough clothing choices. Layers  as a concept is fine, but making that work in urban, suburban, on bike, off bike, in and out of stores kinda a deal can be harder. A few thoughts on that.</p>

<p>Being perfectly comfortable all the time with the range of weather we've been experiencing is difficult. If you want to simplify what you're carrying, change your expectations. Be prepared to be cold or hot some of the time and it all gets easier. Do figure out how hot or cold you're willing to be, and layer accordingly, but if you're determined not to carry clothes, it's hard to cover the range from 36F to 72F, both indoors and out, on bike and off, without some sort of compromise. If you can, please let me know what clothes allowed you to do that.</p>

<p>A great piece for me is a light sweater with a standing collar (1/4 zip). It keeps me warm, rarely gets too hot in an conditioned office or light breeze while keeping me from getting cold and clammy feeling. I have one from North Face (it has a nice fleece lining on the collar) I bought on clearance at EMS on club day (who doesn't like a double discount) but any brand will do... just make sure it's light.</p>

<img align="right" style="margin-right:13px;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/44680-p-detailed.jpg" alt="44680-p-DETAILED.jpg" border="0" width="240" height="240" />

<p>But even as I play chess with the weather I try to simplify other aspects of my life through the continuing search for products that work in more than one setting (thus allowing me to have fewer or less, which in turns reduces my option anxiety). In the shoes that are comfortable in numerous settings category I've inducted <a href="http://www.dansko.com/">Dansko clogs</a>.</p>

<blockquote>"It began with a uniquely designed and patented Danish clog, discovered by company founders Mandy Cabot and Peter Kjellerup, in a tiny shop in Denmark in the late 1980s. This husband and wife team, then professional horse trainers, flipped over their discovery of “the perfect barn shoe,” and, quite literally, put them through two years of “acid-testing.” Mandy and Peter found these shoes to be extraordinarily comfortable, virtually indestructible, and attractive enough to wear almost anywhere. They were the only shoes they ever wore. Mandy and Peter secured the exclusive rights to the stapled clog product line from Denmark, and “Dansko, Inc.” was up and running in 1991."</blockquote>

<p>Nice story eh? Anyway, they're plenty comfortable and can easily fit into work, casual, and chores situations. Casual biking only please (atmo).</p>

<a href="http://www.rapha.cc/merino-boxers/"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/rapha_boxers.png" alt="rapha boxers black" border="0" width="170" height="159" style="float:left;" /></a>

<p>I have a couple of pieces like <a href="http://www.chromebagsstore.com/apparel/mens-apparel.html">Chrome's</a> Shins that have a bit of padding to make biking more comfy without the "it works on the bike but not off" effect of regular bibs or shorts. But because it's built into the clothes, if the look ain't right (I can't really wear knickers at work) then they're not a choice. Providing more options, I'm really enjoying Rapha's new <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/merino-boxers/">merino boxers</a>. Merino is a true wonder material, the Cyfac pad <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/merino-boxers/"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/rapha_cyfac_boxer_pad.png" alt="rapha cyfac boxer pad" border="0" width="310" height="174" style="float:right;margin:13px;" /></a> is useful on the bike but not overwhelming off, and for those trips to park where TheKid™ is on, then off the bike, in, then out of the trailer, playing on the bars and then onto the next thing, they're a great option making the riding more comfy and hanging out off the bike more casual and less technical. Rapha warns to order down one size, I'd say for sure.</p>

<p>Now I know what you're thinking... Aren't they a bit warm? I'll have to keep you posted. So far? Nope. They do sport light mesh panels on the sides which helps them breath. They have flatlocked stitching so the seams won’t chafe, and they do have a fly if you find that helpful. And no... I'll not be modeling them (count yourself lucky).</p>

<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Seriously? You need to ask me if something from Rapha is expensive? In this case, moderately so if you consider what you pay for cycling shorts, significantly so depending on what <strong>you</strong> pay for underwear.]</cite>

<p>Not that it affects any improvement on the layering or performance issues, but a cool T is just that. <a href="http://johanbruyneel.shop.sportstoday.com/Product.aspx?cp=31102_34312&amp;pc=HUCT03"> Johan Bruyneel</a> is branching out from his role as one of the most successful cycling team managers to a purveyor of shmatas. Pave is cool though, so I sport this in good fun. Watch out for the women's sizing, they run small, order up one.</p>
<a href="http://johanbruyneel.shop.sportstoday.com/Product.aspx?cp=31102_34312&amp;pc=HUCT03"><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/cobblestbruneel.jpeg" alt="cobblesTbruneel.jpeg" border="0" width="300" height="300" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4634933869/" title="Jenni n Moi by the Skylands Road sign"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4006/4634933869_5196c0b1d6.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Skylands Road" align="right" style="margin-left:9px;" /></a> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyline_Drive_(New_Jersey)">The Wikipedia states</a>: <blockquote>Skyline Drive is a 5.76-mile[1][2] long road in Northern New Jersey, between Interstate 287 in Oakland, Bergen County and County Route 511 in Ringwood, Passaic County, passing through Ringwood State Park in the Ramapo Mountains. It is a major route for those in the Ringwood and Wanaque area to get to Interstate 287. The road offers a brief view of the Manhattan skyline, 20 miles (32 km) away, while heading southbound. The steep and narrow road is often impassable in winter due to ice and snow. The alignment of Skyline Drive was first designated as a state highway in the 1920s, as an alignment of State Highway Route 3.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I can imagine... but as to major route notice above... if you are <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">not</span> comfortable riding in traffic, <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">do not follow this route</span>. It will make you very uncomfortable.]</cite></p>

<p>But I've already gotten ahead of myself. I ran into Rich the other day. Rich owns a local food place called <a href="http://www.back2earthonline.com/retailer/store_templates/shell_id_1.asp?storeID=D7398816D3694CE69D32041E5FD5A092">Back To Earth Natural Foods</a> and every so often I run into him when I stop by to pick up some stuff. We've ridden together both on and off road... but mostly he mountain bikes and enjoys the woods, and I rarely have the extra time that takes for me. We chatted, and it got me thinking that I should throw my Jones on the rack and get over to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringwood_Manor_State_Park">Ringwood</a> and tool around a bit. And that led me to consider that I could probably ride the fire roads without full on fatties, and in doing so, bring other folks that only ride on the roads with me... hmmm.</p>

<p>So while all that heavy duty conspiring was going on, I ask Jenni if she's riding, and oddly, she says "yes". And more oddly she even has a suggestion for where we should ride. "We should do Skyline."</p>

<p>Jenni immediately notes that I may have broken a record for sandbagging as I remind her that I just spent a week <a href="http://twitter.com/danielberlinger/status/14158200138">crabbin' about my left knee</a>. My rejoinder was that I've had sandbaggin' excuses lined up much further in advance than that... I do try and excel in all things.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4634934555/" title="slow written on the road"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4066/4634934555_63c1ea9e3b.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="7" align="left" style="margin-right:9px;" /></a>
<p>Naturally, neither of us had a clear idea how to get there and far be it from us to look up it before we leave. I admit to having glanced at a map a few days before and seemed like if we just go straight on this road here, we'll see it. I was right, but lacked enough confidence to overcome the confusion and general worry about where we were going.</p>

<p>Down 202, above 17 and up and over the first hill. I recalled nearly collapsing on that hill a bunch of years ago. The day was humid but cool, with a threat of rain and darkened clouds the entire time. One of two drops fell on an occasion, but we got fairly lucky that the showers stayed away. We got pointed to Skylands Road which did not seem like it was Skyline Drive, but seemed close enough to warrant celebrating by getting off our bikes for a picture. We don't often ride in a fashion that makes for a lot of photo taking. It feels like pace killing and not in a good way (hey, were touring!) but in a bad way (we're never getting home). But occasionally we're in that place, and yesterday seemed to be one of those times.</p>

<p style="background-color:black;font-size:80%;color:pink;font-weight:bold;">&larr; An aside: While the tifosi often paint or chalk delightful support of their riders on the roads of the great climbs, Jenni and I find this in the road... repeatedly. Sigh. So it goes.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4635537034/" title="entrance to Ringwood State Park"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4032/4635537034_0c12ff3f8d_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="photo 3" align="left" style="margin-right:9px;" /></a><p>Having poked around we found our route, and proceeded to climb Skyline. It's a decent climb, and we stopped in the one place where you could see a view (although it was too hazy for anything but a back view of the Ramapo Mountains) and have a drink.We made the decision to go over the other side and not just turn around at the top despite us not being sure of the route home. The payoff for a climb is view and the ride down the other side... which was excellent, although since we were not familiar with the route, concerns about traffic and lights kept our max speed in check (42mph).</p>

<p>Jenni then played games with her GPS until it began buzzing at her in a useful manner, and while we couldn't find a pretty way home we started off. As is the way with an unscoped route, we were directed to a wall of a route. A father and son were gardening at the bottom and Jenni asked whether the hill was long (she thirsty, out of water'ish, and in a rare moment, not interested in a long climb) His answer was a snickered "long and hard". I ignored him because he was failing to be cute, or manly, or suggestive, and climbed what turned out to be a short if steep hill. Jenni walked the steepest section, but could have ridden it if she hadn't assumed the clown knew what he was talking about.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/4634934749/" title="Skyline drive picture"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4634934749_5c09e08aee_o.jpg" width="449" height="531" alt="8" align="left" style="margin-right:9px;" /></a>

<p>The rest of the ride home was fairly uneventful. I did notice a lot of road kill deer, which, of course, were almost entirely on the slow uphill side of the road to maximize the odor.</p>

<p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/pecan-pie.jpg" alt="pecan-pie-slice.jpg" border="0" width="144" height="82.5" style="float:right;" />When we got home Jenni picked some bands to be given out to donors, got a bowl and a pile of plasticwear back that she had used to prep food for a friend with cancer, and received a yummy pecan pie which was left from the great pecan pie snafu of May 2010 wherein my mother dropped off a giant pecan pie just after we had procured a personal size pie as part of a multi-dessert finale to the last Shavuot holiday meal. There was probably another 10lbs worth of calories left over in addition to the pecan pie which we're now distributing widely enough as to not impact any individual too greatly (and yet saving ourselves from our love of deliciousness which is antithetical to hill climbing ability).</p>

<p>I love this line from<a href="http://epicmoonflower.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/the-theme-to-todays-ride-also-were-clueless/"> Jenni's post</a>: "I intentionally hadn’t asked Daniel how long we were going to ride- I enjoyed letting the day unfold." If it's not entirely clear, I wouldn't have known how long we were riding, as it was her suggestion, and I had barely glanced at a map. It's a shame she didn't ask—her vicious rejoinder to my response would've been worthwhile.</p>

<p>44 miles and change, 2000+ ft of climbing, lots and lots of fun.</p>

Besides, I enjoy our "we go, we ride, we find, we overcome" deal, where we just make the most of what we find. It's freeing.

Added in this case Bartelby, the class bear, who is given to the child of the day to take home. The accompanying journal entry is left as an exercise for the parents, or in our case, Mommy. I don't need no stinkin' homework.</p>

<p>As I mentioned <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2010/05/11/skates/">not that long ago</a> I remember learning how to skate. So seeing this picture, and that pose, brought back that whole scene again.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to catch a little ice time this Friday. But it's the heart of the Memorial Day weekend getaway, so I may chicken out for another week. We'll see.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I say that about clothes I wear it means that I don't notice the clothes as I wear them. They fit in such a way as not to need adjustment—certainly not near constant adjustment.</p>

<p>Fashion is a complex subject because it is so subjective. While I have learned to understand that fashion doesn't have to be comfortable for some folks, I found a line today that I wish more folks wouldn't cross.</p>

<p>It was a very warm day out for spring in New York. 90F. More like summer than spring around here. As I ran an errand today in the heart of midtown NYC I saw lots of folks from all walks of life, countries, and origins. The melting pot was on full display. As was a great deal of skin. In some cases, way too much in my opinion. In other cases, while folks were still technically dressed, they weren't really covered. And a joy to behold. But that's not the point really.</p>

<p>One woman in particular aimed to walk down the street alternately tugging and lifting her dress. First tugging it down in the back, then lifting it higher in the front. Then tugging, then lifting. All while trying to walk and carry shopping bags.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what herd instinct caused her to put that dress on when she was clearly uncomfortable with what it revealed. And while some would argue fashion, I would say that it becomes a "fashion don't" when you can't walk down the street without adjusting coverage with every step. It's just ridiculous.</p>

<p>So ladies and gentlemen, if you can't wear something revealing without being able to ignore or feel comfortable with the amount of you revealed, consider wearing something that does make you comfortable... and to hell with fashion and what others are wearing. This public service announcement has been brought to you by the letter C and the number 4.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, go read <a href="http://bikehugger.com/2010/05/women-as-outcasts-in-cycling-i.html">Women as Outcasts In Cycling Industry</a> including the comments. (As always, I'll wait).</p>

<p>My disclaimer here is that I know both David and Abby and have some passing familiarity with the problems Abby has faced finding a bike that fits (or that doesn't cause her to throw fits).</p>

<p>If you work around people who wear suits you'll see very few who are wearing clothes that truly fit. Why is that? Pants legs and jacket sleeves that are too long, or extreme bagginess (Must one be able to store a family of marmosets in there? I think not.) Never mind clothes that are <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2010/05/26/comfortable-clothes/">wrong for the person</a> on possibly many levels. The fix for these problems is not expensive. So why?</p>

<p>I see lots of ill fitting bikes. Too small, too big, and less often I see people on the wrong type of bike. So why?</p>

<p>There's a problem created by the need to stock products. Your local store stocks stuff. They want to sell what they stock. People want to buy stuff that's available (I want it now!). Ordering and waiting has to have a significant payoff, and often doesn't.</p>

<p>The bike industry and the clothing industry take a similar approach. They make a range of sizes heavily influenced by their "professional" work. Clothing trends follow "designer" or "couture" trends. Bike industry development is influenced by racing and the needs of the pros. And like all systems there's some failure there. Much as most of us are not an exact and properly fitting size medium (whatever that is), we're are also not (as a collective) small male bike racers. And yet in both cases, we enjoy pretending that we are and making some bad choices along the way.</p>

<p>There's a backlash to this amongst the bike builders. It's sometimes discussed as bike "fit". In other cases its discussed as what you want out of the experience of riding a bike. Listen to the narration of this <a href="http://vimeo.com/11950675">cool little film with Jeff Jones and Sacha White</a> (two incredible builders). And while you can (and should) parse the difference between how a bike fits you physically and the type of bike and the influence that has on the experience of riding it the two are far more closely tied than one would think. And the "custom" bike builders can build a bike that takes into account not just the measurements of your body, but what you tell them about your riding. Assuming you're honest in the process, you'll most likely get a bike that "fits" not just anatomically but stylistically as well. Like I said, it's more important than people think.</p>

<p>The "woman as outcasts" issue is far larger than just the bike industry. As a software developer and someone who builds teams to do that kind of work I can assure you that the software industry does a horrible job of sustaining the interest of woman drawn to technology.</p>

<p>So yeah, there's fewer choices for woman in terms of cycling clothes and fewer parts choices that extend the size range, and as I mentioned above style of riding and the weight range of riders also comes into play. All of which seems to be improving at least a little bit. And the industry is at least becoming aware of the issue of fit as more of us ride. It's not just the racer or wannabe crowds who are buying bikes. Companies are offering bikes in more sizes and trying new ideas about what makes things work (well size symmetry and head tube sizing anyway), and for many of us changing seatposts, stems, handlebars, and cranks, even within the industry limits, can produce a fit that works. But that's the equivalent of shortening cuffs and the like... it's not the same as having clothing or a bike made for you.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that <a href="http://www.sweetpeabicycles.com/blog/lust/">Natalie's</a> Lust line size medium fits me nicely (I could be wrong, I'm kinda in the border between medium and large the irony of which is not lost on me). I wish I could try one. I'd be curious to see how a bike design that is the sum of what Natalie has found works for many of her mostly female customers feels like. Will it leave me with the hard to describe complaint I've heard from many of female bike friends about things "not being comfortable"?  Could be a great way to gain some insight into their problems.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm glad the my female bike friends are finding bikes that are comfortable for them and custom built with them in mind. One day, I hope to do the same for myself.</p>

		<title>Wheel hotness: Mad Fiber carbon fiber wheelset</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://velonews.competitor.com/2010/05/bikes-tech/tech-update-ric-hjertberg-launches-mad-fiber-carbon-fiber-wheelset_119383">Tech Update: Ric Hjertberg launches Mad Fiber carbon fiber wheelset</a>: <div style="width:250px;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-119390" href="http://velonews.competitor.com/2010/05/bikes-tech/tech-update-ric-hjertberg-launches-mad-fiber-carbon-fiber-wheelset_119383/attachment/mad_fiber6"><img title="Mad Fiber wheels" src="http://velonews.competitor.com/files/2010/05/mad_fiber6-300x200.jpg" alt="The set" width="240" height="160" align="left" style="margin-right:9px;" /></a></div>
<p>Ric Hjertberg and his new company Mad Fiber is bringing out a wild-looking carbon wheelset with a claimed weight of just 1085 grams and aerodynamics claimed to be on par with the best in the industry.</p>
<p>If Hjertberg’s name sounds familiar, it’s because he’s been associated with wheelbuilding, since founding Wheelsmith Fabrications in 1980.  Now, a few years after ending his stint as New Technology Manager with Full Speed Ahead, he’s back on the scene with the new venture.</p>
<p>Hjertberg said he set out to make a wheel light enough for the steepest climbs, aero enough for the worst crosswinds, and durable enough for riders of every build.</p>
<p>Hjertberg points to several distinct aspects of the new wheel:</p>
<a rel="attachment wp-att-119385" href="http://velonews.competitor.com/2010/05/bikes-tech/tech-update-ric-hjertberg-launches-mad-fiber-carbon-fiber-wheelset_119383/attachment/mad_fiber1"><img title="Mad Fiber wheels" src="http://velonews.competitor.com/files/2010/05/mad_fiber1-300x199.jpg" alt="Flanges and spokes" width="300" height="199" align="right" style="margin-left:9px;" /></a>
<ul><li>Instead of building the carbon rim to mimic the shape and properties of an extruded aluminum rim, Mad Fiber builds the rim by joining three separately constructed pieces (two sidewalls and the tire seat). Hjertberg says it’s lighter and stronger this way.</li>
<li>Instead of drilling the rim to accommodate metal spokes, Mad Fiber bonds wide carbon spokes to both the rim walls and hub flanges. Again, this preserves the integrity of the rim and makes it stronger at a lower weight.</li>
<li>To tension the wheel, the carbon spokes are assembled to length and fixed to the flanges at the hub center. Then a fixture precisely moves the flanges to their correct position on the hub shell before they’re affixed in place. Spreading the flanges with the spokes already attached to both the flanges and rim creates spoke tension.</li>
<li>The wheels are handmade in Seattle and carry no rider weight restrictions.</li>
<li>The company says they meet and exceed multiple fatigue and durability tests, including DIN and CEN standardized tests plus a battery of tests of their own invention. They carry a four-year warranty and crash replacement program. The titanium freehub body is made by White Industries and sports three-pawl/24-tooth engagement and a 15mm chromoly axle.</li></ul>
<p>The wheels will be available this summer. They will retail for $2600, and ship with lightweight quick release skewers, cork brake pads, wheel bags, and valve extenders.</p> <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Badass]</cite> <br />

<p>On Thursday, Mark Z. and I took a moment to see the <a href="http://collections.madmuseum.org/code/emuseum.asp?emu_action=advsearch&amp;rawsearch=exhibitionid/,/is/,/516/,/true/,/false&amp;profile=exhibitions">"bespoke" exhibit of hand made bicycles at MAD</a>. It's a nice display of some of the finest bikes made by hand today. The irony of the bike rental business on the corner, while just inside were wheelsets that cost more than several rentals was not lost on us. Another irony was the mud covered Richard Sachs 'cross bike which the guard would shoo people away from if they even tried to touch it... something tells me Richard would just shake his head, atmo.</p>

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/screen-shot-2010-06-13-at-7-03-36-pm.png" alt="Screen shot 2010-06-13 at 7.03.36 PM.png" border="0" width="344" height="708" style="float:right;" />

<p>As I've said before I've yet to commit to a "bespoke" cycle... but one day.</p>

<p>However in the world of cycling ignominy is never far away—at least for me. Lloyd and John posted this nice ride they do up to Cold Spring and beyond. In need of nice long ride I planned to go despite having to wake up early on the one day when I don't have to... 5am came early as it were.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50834669@N00/4697428657" title="View 'Where my spoke broke' on Flickr.com"><img /></a>

<p>Six of us started out from Rockland Lake heading north up the rollers of 9W, dropped into Haverstraw, and met up with three others. We climbed up toward Bear Mountain bridge and crossed over continuing up 9D. As I get nearly as far away from home as I'm going to get, I hear the loudest "bang" I've ever heard come from my bike. I thought I had flatted, so I slowed and stopped carefully, but it didn't look like it, and once stopped, it was clearly not the problem, and yet the wheel was not really turning. And then I saw it.</p>

<p>There was a spoke unattached at the hub end. "That's gonna be a hassle." I thought. I knew that I didn't have a spoke wrench on my multi tool. And while I opened the brake and tried to re-orient the wheel in the frame enough to limp home, it was a no go. The wheel was significantly out of true.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50834669@N00/4698053562" title="View 'Broken Spoke' on Flickr.com"><img /></a>

<p>Just then Lloyd and (the other) John came riding by (I'm not sure why they were that far behind me) and the stopped to help. Lloyd broke off the dangling spoke, but without a spoke wrench we were kinda stuck. They didn't have anything on their tools either. There'd be no limping home. All that was left was calling Lisa and asking to be picked up. Luckily she had a morning of chores planned, and was home and could quickly throw The Kid in the car and made her way to me... but still... I'm almost as far away from home as I planned to be that day. (Darn you Murphy!) Nor was I close to any of the bike shops in the area that would have come and picked me up (because they're awesome around here.)</p>

<p>Phone call made, I sent Lloyd and (the other) John on their way and tried not to go stir crazy waiting... now of course, all of this could have been worse. It could have started raining for example. But even then, I happened to stop by Hudson Highlands State Park, so there was a little covered message board that I could have hidden under. And while it was cool, I did have rain jacket with me... and food and water. All in all... not the worst conditions in which to wait. I only called Lisa three times...</p>

<p>I've taken away some thoughts for the future.</p>
<ol>
<li>I put a spoke wrench in my seat bag. Already. As in I already got one of the right size and put it in the bag.</li>
<li>I could have salvaged the ride home if I had a spare set of wheels pumped up and ready to go in every way sitting where Lisa would know she had the right wheels. This is a bit more complicated, but I took the steps I could today. I need to get a set of wheels with matching rims to really make this pain free... but in the meantime I've prepped a set and made a spot for them to live. When I check the pressure on the bike set, I check those too. I'd move them into Lisa's car, but that'll get in her way most of the time, so I'll leave them in the newly created spot.</li>
<li>Lastly, I need to put *all* the phone numbers I need into my cell phone. As long as I have a cell connection I can look up the phone numbers I need. But what if I don't? I might be able to borrow a cup of phone, but internet access? Lots harder 'round the state parks. I can't run up 411 access fees on someone's phone either... it would make it harder for the next person who needs their help to get it (regardless of whether I pay for it or not. Just my feeling, but still.)</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd take a few hours of riding on a wobbly wheel over dragging my wife (or anyone else) out on the road to help me while I wait. And a little preparation could've rescued the ride. She even could've grabbed another bike, but the rack isn't on her car and putting a bike in the car is not easy (to say the least)... so wheels it would be.</p>

<p> I thought about bringing extra wheels to the <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2010/03/22/battenkill%e2%80%94sometimes-you-get-to-be-part-of-something-great/">Battenkill</a> ride, but because I didn't think of it until the last minute I was, again, unprepared. I'll do better next time. Seems a shame to lose a day to something that a minute wheel change could save. Especially in that case where we really did have a "team" car.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/img_0002.jpg" alt="fathers_day_snake_paperholder" border="0" width="130" height="160" style="float:left;margin-right:9px;" /> <p>I got up a little after 5 a.m. and splashed some water on my hands and face then checked my email. I took some dried fruit from the kitchen and munched for a minute while I read before going to the bathroom to put on my cycling clothes. I didn't want to disturb Lisa and now Noah who was, as is his style, sleeping distributed all over the bed. The price for caring this morning was paid by absolutely nailing my left knee into the edge of the bathroom vanity. Our bathrooms are really too small for dressing. Other than the nearly stifled curse, I didn't give it much thought although it did, I noticed later, leave quite a goose egg (and now a bruise). I came back into the kitchen and poured lots water in a glass that has a bike etched into its side, then sat quietly for a few minutes munching and drinking. I opened Noah's father's day present, a snake that had a clothes pin set into to the top "to hold all my papers" that had been hand painted and formed by The Kid. I pumped up the <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2010/06/13/bespoke-later-for-now-it-spoke-no-more/">replacement rear wheel</a> and all seemed good. I rolled down my hill right around 6:30 and pedaled through Wesley Hills then north toward the hills and Harriman.</p>

<p>I had skipped the outer layers and was chilly going down the hill, but it seemed prudent. It would be warm later and I didn't want to carry all that stuff.</p>

<p>I told myself what a great morning it was and turned onto Camp Hill Road thinking about the wisdom of long sleeves, the sand and gravel on the road and where I wanted to ride. I thought about Noah and Lisa, the architecture of the houses beside me, and the rapidly fading morning sun, and friends, and people and places of a long time ago.  The clouds looked ever more threatening but I was not to be intimidated.</p>

<p>My hands on the top of the bar, the sun no longer displayed my shadow on the road. I hit the first small climb, and felt my left knee complain. Look at that. "That hurts" I thought as I gently rubbed my hand past the spot where I had driven the vanity into my knee. I wondered how long my knee would hold up.</p>

<p>Some cyclists blew  by on a down hill and after some brief morning banter I turned off to continue. I briefly thought about hanging with them as long as I could, but I wasn't in the mood to work that hard just yet.</p>

<p>As I climbed the first real hill the woods exploded with bird song. Lots of species I didn't recognize raucously cheering on my climbing. My own personal Alpe D'huez like cheering squad. A deer on the side of the road couldn't even be bothered to step away from me though we could have brushed shoulders. So much for exuding power and ferociously attacking the climb.</p>

<p>33.26 miles and 2575 feet of climbing later my knee held up fine. But my bike once again was not. My rear tire was flat I realized climbing the last significant bit of hill as I neared home. "Meh", I said to myself, "it must be a slow leak, and I only have a few miles left". I took out a cartridge and poured CO2 into the tire. Nice and solid. Then I hear the hissing... Sad. I was hoping to avoid changing a rear tire this close to home, but I guess not. Tube? Check. Levers? Check. Someplace to sit while I do this that's not in the middle of the road? Check. Second CO2 cartridge? uh, Second CO2 cartridge? Oh bother.</p>

<p>So for the second time in two weeks I called the "Team Car" to come and get me. Fortunately, Lisa and Noah were just about to go out, and I was just a few miles from home. So lickety split they were there. Some nice cyclist stopped to help, but I explained that there was no need and I'd be fine in just a few minutes. As a bonus since I rode from home, Lisa was able to take the car with the rack on it to make things even simpler all around.</p>

<p>For solo riding I'm now adding a mini-pump to the kit bag. And hopefully this will change my current ride karma and I can make it all the way home on the next ride.</p>

<p>Noah wanted to stay with me, so we watched parts of the most recent Star Trek movie (he likes the space parts, no exposition, please, and is very sensitive to the feelings of the heros, so we edit as we go). We then went ice skating at the local rink, met the lovely and helpful Jill, who was willing to watch and play with Noah both on and off the ice while I helped Lisa get her bearings, and then we came home made dinner, and "picnicked" in the family room watching the end of the Tour de Suisse.</p>

<p>All in all it was a great father's day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is exactly what my weekend needs.

<img src="http://jhische.com/dailydropcap/X-7-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" align="left" alt="X" />acta-freakin'-absolutely what I need to heal up from this week. This week was... unpleasant.

<p>I guy with a shopping cart walks up to me yesterday. "You were in the Marines, weren't you?" (Nope. Sorry.) "You look a like military guy. Army?" (Nope. Sorry). "Any of the services? Navy?" (Nope. Sorry.) His wallet was out by now and a card that he's using to represent that he's a Vietnam vet is out. "Can you spare a few for a Vet?" (Nope. Sorry). "You sure are sorry, bitch..." as he runs his cart over my toes in anger. Part of me really wanted to kick his ass. I don't like that about myself.</p> 

<p>Another guy nearly crushed me into a bus while parking illegally using his commercial plates (a plumber maybe?) to park across from the Food Emporium and go buy some dinner. He decided to lecture me with yelling and gestures since I refused to be crushed. He nearly kills me and this is what I get?  Part of me really wanted to kick his ass. I don't like that about myself.</p>

<p>I rarely come home and think "I need a drink". I did last night. (That is, I thought it. I didn't have the drink... too much to do.)</p>

<p>Yes, there were some nice things about the week as well. But it was really filled with stuff like that. The heat maybe? Dunno. But I need the peace of the roads, the climbs and the outdoors.</p>

<p>See yah out there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>More interesting this week was writing my first <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://guides.rails.info/3_0_release_notes.html">Rails3</a> app. An internal helper app, something that makes our lives just a touch easier. It's the sort of app that <a href="http://37signals.com/">37Signals</a> would turn into a revenue stream. There's one more feature I'd like to see added but the core is there and working well.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often people ask me about tweets or posts or other utterances they run across and don't understand. I thought I'd mention a few recurring themes that may provide some context for some of these things.</p>

<p>I've spent a lifetime studying design and designing things. Many things I've designed are "soft" as in software design and features, web apps and the like. Many are not, like wooden trays, houses, cities, fixtures, furniture, lamps, etc.</p>

<p>Working with electrons is very different than working with atoms. Atoms are expensive in ways that electrons are not. There is a finality to their current state that informs their use, and within the act of creation there is an alteration that may only occur once for that object in its lifetime. For example, each piece of wood is different. There might be similar, but none alike. Ruin the piece and it is gone forever. Electrons lack permanence. They are etherial, coming and going at seemingly their own whim. They require "backup" and other schemes to preserve the designs intent and ensure orderly availability of some collection of electrical impulses when they are desired.</p>

<p>And so there is a balance to be found in working with both. They both require patience and tolerance from me. They both demand attention and care and thoughtfulness. But I can put my hands on and smell and touch the atoms and so the experience of building with them is very different. Bringing the design to life is a key part of the process for me. Design on paper or CAD or pencil sketch is just thinking. The execution is just as important to me.</p>

<p>Here's Jon Ives <a href="http://twitter.com/danielberlinger/statuses/17511338746">talking about</a> some of his (currently) recent work. And <a href="http://twitter.com/danielberlinger/statuses/17488711588">here</a> I pass on some advice to my team about things that inform my approach to work... and my off the cuff <a href="http://twitter.com/danielberlinger/status/16971142357">response</a> to how things are going.</p>

<p>And some of it is pure tech. Can't help you there. Look up some terms of you care to... although if you're interested I'm willing to help but mostly, people wave and say "it's over my head." So not true.</p>

<p>And then there's cycling stuff. Most of you follow that, though there can be obtuse references like <a href="http://twitter.com/danielberlinger/status/17506965982">3391</a>.</p>

<a href="http://grainedit.com/2010/06/29/script-and-seal-posters/"><img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/grainedit-scriptseal-5.jpg" alt="grainedit-scriptseal-5.jpg" border="0" width="470" height="615" /></a> <p>(I love <a href="http://grainedit.com/">grain edit</a>!) Allez!</p>

<p>Anyway, there are some of the circular themes that don't seem obvious from the outside, but are obvious from the inside. I expect that explains almost nothing.</p>

		<title>The Rapha Cycle Club Opening</title>

<p>I love the quote they chose for the wall.</p>

<p>Rapha opened their pop-up, the <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/nyc">Rapha Cycling Club</a> last night.</p>

<p>I walked down there after work which was interesting in and of itself. Since we're talking style, let me say this. Woman of New York: Should you decide to wear a clingy knit dress, or a tight shirt, etc. and clearly some of you do, consider the effect of the clothes you wear beneath the outer garment. The seemingly intended effect is ruined by bunched, loose, ill fitting, poorly coordinated under garments. To be fair I saw some equally egregious lack of coordinated efforts from men, but who cares? Just another slob.</p>

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/rapha_club_entrance.jpg" alt="rapha_club_entrance" border="0" width="240" height="180" style="float:left;margin-right:9px;" /><p>Anyway. I got down there quite a bit early, and killed some time checking out the neighborhood. As it got closer to the right time I just barged in. I was quickly welcomed by Slate Olson and later Derrick Lewis. We chit chatted, and I learned that Rapha doesn't know what they're doing with their currently engineless broom wagon when the 3 months are up. Might you have a suggestion?</p>

<p>There was a lovely spread and some great cycling artifacts on display. Some of the Paul Smith items they collborations were on display including the lovely <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/paul-smith-courier-bag/">courier bag</a>.</p>
<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/4753920196_365ae582f0_m.jpg" alt="the spread" border="0" width="240" height="180" style="float:right;margin-left:9px;" />
<p>Not long after fondling that very bag I heard a small crash behind me, and someone had had the misfortune of placing the bag back on the shelf and having the shelf collapse to the floor. In the whirlwind that followed I met <a href="http://www.acontinuouslean.com/about/">Michael from A Continuous Lean</a>. I had met him once before at some other event that has faded into the dusty cobwebs of my mind, but it was nice to chat with him. A regular read from the design and manufacturing side of life.</p>

<p>The place really filled up as things got started officially, Stella's were being served, coffee was brewed, and the food consumed. (I had a walnut the size of my fist...) It would be nice to catch a ride with some of these folks, especially if they plan to come up to Rockland (a classic New York ride).</p>

<p>Congrats to all the folks who worked hard to get the place going for the summer. There'll be daily airings of the Tour etc. 352 Bowery, New York, NY 10012, (Down by Cooper Union) Phone: 212.228.1529,  *Opening 3rd July, 2010.* The bar is run by <a href="http://www.thirdrailcoffee.com/">ThirdRailCoffee</a> who are planning some cuppings and coffee related things. There's interior bike parking as well. </p>

		<title>FedEx -1 or so, AT&amp;T +1</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/800px-fedex-truck-chicago.jpg" alt="A typical FedEx delivery truck. Photograph taken in Chicago, Illinois on August 26, 2005 by Kelly Martin." border="0" width="400" height="294" style="float:left;margin-right:9px;" />

<p><a href="http://fedex.com/">FedEx</a>, the oft revered delivery company, has got some issues brewing. Here's two of them.</p>

<p>There's a company who's goods I purchase. They ship <a href="http://fedex.com/">FedEx</a> signature required. They offer no options (that's another story). This is a problem because often no one is home when they attempt delivery. That means either traveling to the <a href="http://fedex.com/">FedEx</a> facility and picking it up (that's not what I call delivery) or signing the door tag and leaving that on my front door.</p>

<p>most people just sign the door tag and wait another day. I find that annoying since the package was literaly on my doorstep already. Further, if the signature is supposed provide security, the doortag does the opposite. It announces for all who drive by that there will be a package left on my stoop sometime soon. There is no way (from what I understand) to inform FedEx of when a good time to deliver the package would be, so I can't help them deliver the package securely.</p>

<p>Recently, they started calling to inform me that a package that requires a signature will be arriving the next giving me the option leaving a preemptive doortag of my own making for the driver, once again announcing that package will be there soon, and now saving them a trip but not improving security one bit. So FedEx's situation is improved by the phone call, but mine has not since again, they provide no opportunity to give them feedback as to when a good delivery time would be, or maybe even a "press 2 in liu of leaving a sign on your door that screams 'a package that is so cool and expensive it required a signature will be here, on this very spot, later.' "</p>

<p>And if that's not annoying enough. The Dude In Charge at work kindly upgraded the phone we use for testing and development which I carry. He ordered the upgrade which <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</a> is shipping. They do not have a corporate name associated with the account so it ships to the company address without the company name, and the FedEx delivery person doesn't know what to do with it (and/or the mailroom rejects it). Delivery Exception is noted on the FedEx tracking site. Again, with no way to help FedEx get the package destined for you, to you. Nor information about where to call or find your local FedEx delivery station which is noted as "At Local Fedex Facility: New York, NY, US". Really? No street address... nothing. In a city the size of NY. Seriously.</p>

<p>So I ask around and someone suggest calling them. Hah, I think. How mid-fifties. But since their website provided no useful information, I called. I choose the track option and the computer notes the delivery exception and passes me on to a rep. The rep informs me that the package is at a FedEx store around the corner. I explain that I will be going to pick up this package despite it being in the name of The Dude In Charge, and ask what ID or whatever I should I bring with me? She says a letter from The Dude In Charge with my name explaining that I will be picking it up on his behalf, and a photo ID.</p>

<p>Fully armed with said stuffs, I waltz around the corner. The counter guy plugs in the numbers and says sorry that package isn't here. Backing and forthing commences, and he explains (with true sorrow) that the package is at the main place 606 49th between 11th &amp; 12th. OK I think, I go by there every day, so I head over there.</p>

<p>Parking is nonexistant, so I park illegally in the Charter bus parking spots and kept on eye on my car. The counter person can't be bothered to look up or offer a greeting. Nice. I hand over the letter with the tracking number and explaining who I am. I'm then informed that the package is there but she can't release it unless AT&amp;T says so. Why did no one else mention this to me? "I called ya'll" I said and they told me to bring this exact documentation with me. "Yeah. We have trouble with them." Great. "Them". As if "Them" wasn't wearing a FedEx uniform and answering the phone for FedEx. I walked out empty handed.</p>

<p>Does all this sound like a good experience?</p>

<p>As I'm commuting home AT&amp;T was informed of the Exception and called the current phone (which I carry) to ask if I could provide the missing info... which I was able to provide so (if FedEx doesn't screw up again) it should be deliverable. We'll find out in the morning.</p>

<p>While folks whine about AT&amp;T all the time, they did get this right. They didn't just shrug and say it's FedEx's issue to deliver it, it's literally out of our hands, they're actively trying to get stuff delivered to their customers. FedEx on the other hand isn't helping their customer (AT&amp;T) and is delivering a bad experience for folks at both ends of their service.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ups.com/">UPS</a> should be thrilled.</p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[We all love you and miss you too, it's been quite a while. I'm riding early Sunday as of now. Lemme know if you care to join. 

As for AT&amp;T... I know. Lots of similar stories from people. But I've managed to call you a number of times and I seem to reach you. How is that? I think people's frustration when they can't far exceed the real stats of the situation.

Sure, my daily phone call with Lisa on my home has certain spots that drop every single day. But I don't ever recall it being any other way with Verizon or T-Mobile.

But while those things can be discussed, they got this part right and therefore got the +1

From a business case you can argue that FedEx gets the more important portion of their business correct, most packages arriving on time, where expected, etc. But they do have a last mile problem where the services they offer the "company that ships the product" don't align with needs of the receiver. I know that FedEx could deliver stuff me without all the hassle, but the shippers of product don't want the hassle of "I never got it" things happening. So this is cheaper and easier for them, but annoys me, the customer. Not so good for them either.

In the end, I'm the customer all the way 'round since I pay for shipping... thus my annoyance at the company that simplifies their end by only offering one shipping option and cost and there's no way for me to really make it work. I pay more for speedier shipping thatI don't get because there's that day lag tacked on almost every time. Seriously annoying.

FedEx is doing a disservice to the companies who choose to offer their service in addition to me, the actual user of their service. That's not good. It makes me ask these companies to offer other shipping services. Which I do all the time now.

AT&amp;T seems to have done an OK job with the data portion of their network. They seem to continue to have reception problems in densely inhabited areas, and they're press handling and messaging has been gawdawful. But some smart person got this right, and they deserve to hear that. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I wouldn't care if AT&amp;T baked me cookies and gave me a foot rub, they will not gain +1 from me.  Delivery issues or not, I still and largely unable to make a PHONE CALL.  

And to call and tell them I'm having so much trouble making phone calls, I was berated because I have not told them I'm having so much trouble (p.s. I have gotten a credit on my account because of my complaining almost every month since the very first month I signed with them).  They call this a courtesy credit.  

Then they asked me to install an app on my phone so I could work for them and fill out all their information about where/when/why I'm having trouble. 

I'm going to skip to the end and just say...
UGH.  Delivery deshmivery.   

Also, love you, miss you.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2010/07/08/fedex-1-or-so-att-1/">In the end</a> FedEx shipped the package back to the sender, it having fallen afowl of FedEx's policy about cell phone shipments which it can't seem to make clear on their incredibly horrendous site.</p>

<p>The policy runs something like this <blockquote>"We're not releasing this package unless (fuzzy FedEx stuff known only to them but is similar to) someone signs for this at the valid address that we brought it to, and no you cannot pick it up or a sign a door tag that we leave for you because we're not leaving it anyway, unless the company that shipped the phone says we can, and btw, don't bother because there's no way for the them to tell us that anyway."</blockquote></p>

<p>A friend had a similar experience with FedEx and cell phone (different phone, different phone company) where they FedEx left a door tag. She signed it, and the next found another door tag but no package. When she called FedEx they said that they wouldn't leave the phone despite the signature... but neither door tag explained that... which in my mind explains the attitude failure that FedEx displays almost all the time. They're people don't care if they actually deliver the package.</p>

<p>"Delivery" is also a shady word in FedEx's world since I don't believe the package I was trying to pry out of their hands ever left their routing facility. The "mailroom" here is fairly efficient, and in my experience a good natured and hard working bunch. If a FedEx person had said "Hey, I've got this package for someone named X, do you have any idea?" I'd bet that package would've made it to our collective desk. But I don't think they ever made that attempt because the address didn't pass their validation without a suite number or company name. Why could an invalid address be allowed into their system? Dunno. But now that it made been flown half across the country it was undeliverable, and not releasable. It never left the facility from where they wouldn't release it to someone who arrived to fetch it (moi), and have now sent it back to where it came from, with everyone losing. I know <strong>we're</strong> not paying for all this nonsense, <strong>that's for sure</strong>, except in annoyance and lost time.</p>

<p>At some point we'll have to go through another round with AT&amp;T to get an upgrade phone shipped out to an address where we stand a chance of getting it delivered. But this whole thing sucked, and like I said, can only be causing execs at UPS to roll on the floor laughing, and hopefully, to pay attention to the difference they can ensure their service maintains. Don't ever do this stuff to your customers... it's a business ending failure if not corrected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://bicycling.com/tour-de-france-2010/maillot-jaune">“I think he’s trying,” says Eki, “to wear the yellow jersey.”</a> Aren't we all? But what this year's Tour seemed to point out more than many others I've watched over the years is how you get there is more important to everyone.</p>

<p>It seemed like last year this lesson had begun to sink in. "It’s kind of cool to be the one up front pulling." was heard to be said by Lance. Being the one up front pulling has rewards that last a lifetime. Just ask Big George.</p>

<p>Cycling has a benefit over many other sports besides its accessibility (anyone can ride). It can have style and it can lend you style. You can be the personification of a style, or your style can be a manifestation of who you are. Or both at various times. The long hours on the road can distill the essence of your being even as it instills new qualities as you explore your limits. It's much like practicing a musical instrument. It inhabits you even as you illuminate it. (Nietzsche would be proud). This symmetry continues.</p>

<p>This year's Tour also taught people manners and noblesse oblige. You do not need to wait, but you do not need to attack. There is a middle ground though it can be tough to find for some people. For some it seems to be black and white: “Everyone can attack when it is easy. You win races by attacking when it hurts, you attack when it is hard, when your legs are burning, when everyone else is breathing hard and you are suffering. That is when you attack.” Maybe, in its purest, noblest sense. But in reality people are scared and confused and they attack when an opportunity presents itself. That is human nature. But I love that so many people feel that the Tour isn't just about raw human emotion, courage, and suffering, but also, and possibly more so about sportsmanship, elegance, and a profound respect for your competitors. And I hope that they act that way in their own lives.</p>

<p>The road humbles us all. The miles pile up and they write a story on our faces and bodies. The windy flats, the climbs, and the "lumpy" rollers. So often it feels like the road attacks us; climbs lurking around each curve like a terrorists bomb; never letting the ride relax into a painless cruise. They explode our lungs and hearts, remind us of our responsibilities, our limitations, and in the end, we seek them out to grind those edges off our lives.</p>

<p>This year Armstrong went out the way he came in: digging deep, enjoying the pain and riding, at times, like a champion. Love him, hate him or whatever, he will leave a chasm in the sport now that he's done for good (I hope he doesn't make a fool out of me here, but I think not). Maybe he can do more good just pulling for others now.</p>

<p>The next time you’re on the rivet, crosseyed, and attempting to fly up some hill, or launching your next move, things  will be clearer because of this year's Tour. Courage and defiance. Anger and revenge. Apology and remorse. All were present this year to encourage and teach us. The symmetry continues.</p>

<p>This year celebrated the 100 anniversary of the inclusion of the Pyrannees in the race. The scouts for the Tour famously reported the inclusion of  Col du Tourmalet as "parfaitement praticable" (perfectly fair) while the riders found the Mountain climbs so difficult that “Vous êtes des assassins!” – ‘You are assassins’ spat Octave Lapize to onlookers and Tour officials as he struggled over the Col d’Aubisque in the 1910 Tour. It was also that year that a small concession was introduced for the first time by Degrange—la voiture-balai, the infamous broom-wagon to sweep up any riders unable to carry on. Without one, there is no need for the other.</p>

<p>The Tour will end shortly and someone will have won. And life will press on. The intensity of sporting events is that they distill life to simple rules and boundaries. The majesty is that we can carry the lessons with us into our lives and use what we've learned to make a difference in a way that truly matters. Riding a bike is a perfect metaphor. Find a balance, pull for others, then seek the yellow jersey.</p>

<p>Allez!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>What you still need to know is this. Before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we’ve learned as we move toward that dream. That’s the point at which most people give up. It’s the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon. Every search begins with beginner’s luck and every search ends with the victor being severely tested.</blockquote>

<p>—Paulo Coelho, from The Alchemist</p>

<p>Billykirk: <a href="http://billykirkcom.blogspot.com/2010/07/what-you-still-need-to-know-is-this.html">We must all remember it's not just reaching our goals, no matter what they happen to be, but also what actions we used to attain them.</a></p>

<p>That said...</p>

<p>Our family moves on to the back half of the "summer" (not the season, but the school year defined break) now that the Tour is over. Watching the Tour is a family institution, possibly even a celebration ritual of our summer. If only we got the month off, it would be far easier to follow along. Yet, we make the time.</p>

<p>Which leads to what we're trying to do now... such as clean up the house, move projects forward, some of us hope to visit friends, and I'm trying to think about the <a href="http://philly2010.livestrong.org/faf/home/default.asp?ievent=330113">Philly Challenge</a>. If you have a second... I'd appreciate <a href="http://philly2010.livestrong.org/daniel">a donation</a>. I've got some cool swag to give away and any donation greater than $5 is eligible for a prize. (Multiples of 5 equal one entry per 5, so $25.00 gets you 5 entries...)</p>

<div class="entry"><p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2474-lavers-law-of-fashion">Laver's Law of Fashion</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Laver">James Laver</a> was a museum curator for the Victoria and Albert Museum in London from the ‘30s through the ‘50s. He was also a fashion theorist and historian who conceived Laver’s Law — an attempt to make sense of the fashion trend lifecycle.</p>

<p>Here is Laver’s Law:</p>

<p>Stanley Marcus, the former president of Neiman Marcus, recounts in his memoir <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Minding-Store-Stanley-Marcus/dp/157441139X">Minding the Store</a> how Laver’s Law was used by Neiman Marcus clothes buyers in the late 60’s. There was a heated internal debate on whether the trend for that next year would still be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniskirt">mini skirt</a> (which was the current fashion) or the longer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniskirt#1970s">midi skirt</a>. Marcus asked Laver point blank if the mini skirt was dead. Laver told him that the mini skirt had at least another 2 years to go — against expert opinion at the time.</p>


<blockquote>His forecast was right, the midi was a complete flop, many women continued to wear the miniskirt, and those who couldn’t or wouldn’t make up their minds went into the pants suit. Pants were bound to come, but the skirt-length controversy made pants acceptable at an accelerated rate.</blockquote>

<p>The brilliance of this timeline is that it can be applied to nearly all creative mediums — not just fashion but also art, design, architecture, and even music. <strong>Smart</strong>, or Current Fashion, doesn’t have a particular time frame attached to it. Something can be smart for 1 year or a even few years.</p>

<p>Think back to some of the trendy things of the past and you’ll see how it applies: <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/dynamic/imgs/090122/Apple-Steve-Jobs/Rainbow-Imacs_l.jpg">candy colored iMacs</a>, <a href="http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs25/f/2008/178/2/c/Victorian_Wallpaper_1_by_MJK_Stock.jpg">Victorian wallpaper</a>,<a href="http://www.fonthaus.com/showings/emigre/Igif/EM21164.gif"> Emigre fonts</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM72iWami9M">Disco</a>, <a href="http://www.searsarchives.com/homes/images/1915-1920/1920_3058.jpg">Sears homes of the 1920’s</a>, <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/category.jsp?_DARGS=/urban/catalog/common/highlited_itemcount.jsp_A&amp;_DAV=false&amp;itemCount=80&amp;navCount=&amp;navAction=jump&amp;id=TRENDS_PREPPY&amp;100712trends">Preppy clothes</a>, <a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/2009/12/panic-retro-art/">Atari video game box covers</a>, and <a href="http://blog.eyemagazine.com/?p=388">Braun products of the late-50’s early 60’s</a>.</p>

<p>Hitting that sweet spot around Daring and Smart when you’re trying to design, create or sell something is crucial. There’s even a market for Dowdy too, right?  Just look around at your local mall or shopping center. Just remember that in a few years it’ll start to look bad. In 10 years it’ll look <span>REALLY</span> bad. Then, after some time, it will be appreciated — or even revered — again. I take comfort that something like Comic Sans (theoretically) will have a shot at being beautiful in 100 years time.</p><div>

Nehru Jackets clearly fall under Amusing/Quaint
Blue polyester leisure suits were Hideous then and forever remain in that category, pinned by the faulty process that created them in the first place.

For the PJ's I'll go with Shameless/Outré with a side order of meh. I suspect they could be stylish depending on the pattern, fabric, and person involved. I suspect that it is simply laziness rather than fashion driven, and therefore the effect is "bad housecoat". Fashion rarely includes laziness, especially if it strives to look that way.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2434-the-danger-in-relying-on-sophisticated-virtual">QUOTE</a>: The danger in relying on [sophisticated virtual design tools] too much is that we can end up isolated from the physical world. In our quest to quickly make three-dimensional objects, we can miss out on the experience of making something that helps give us our first understandings of form and material, of the way a material behaves—’I press too hard here, and it breaks here’ and so on…It’s very hard to learn about materials academically, by reading about them or watching videos about them; the only way you truly understand a material is by making things with it.
<p>—<a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/core77_speaks_with_jonathan_ive_on_the_design_of_the_iphone_4_material_matters_16817.asp">Jonathan Ive, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Design, discussing materials and the iPhone 4</a></p>

<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[<a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2010/07/01/explaining-nothing/">I mentioned this before</a>. Living only in a digital, virtual world lacks balance and doesn't engage senses that we've developed over lifetimes.]</cite>

<blockquote>It will probably surprise you to find out that we actually have no dedicated support personnel inside of New Relic!  Each and every support request is handled by a development engineer who has full access to our entire source base, and the full authority to do whatever is necessary to make things right.</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>Until then, I think it’s great that our development engineers have responsibility not only for writing great software, but supporting it too.  In the long run, I think it makes for happier customers and a better product.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Who climbs with toil, wheresoe'er
Shall find wings waiting there —<a href="http://www.daypoems.net/poems/804.html">Henry Charles Beeching, 'Going down Hill on a Bicycle, A Boy's Song'</a></blockquote>


<img style="float:left;margin-right:9px;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/perkins_memorial_drive.jpg" alt="perkins memorial drive" border="0" width="320" height="240" />
<p>I think my left knee hurts too much. Besides, I want Pantani like wings for going up, not the more pedestrian wings we all find coming down. I climb because I must. 3500ft worth today. Why must I? Because it makes me stronger, and saws off my delusions. It gives me time to think until just going uphill is all there is...</p>

<p>I can't or won't push my knee hard enough to find my mental limits. I have other responsibilities. And If I go too far, they will be impacted. So I spin and then stand and well, I wouldn't call it dance, but whatever. I do what I can. And if the steep pitches aren't too long (there were several 15% or more grades today, short enough for me to conquer them) I can push over the top and feel the miles—the small successes that make up eventual victory. The hills may not yet be mine, but one day... I'll find my wings.</p>

<p>Overall things went well today but because of busted water fountain I ran out of water again. This is beginning to form a pattern that I'm not enjoying, nor is Lisa despite her lack of complaining. I caught her at a less than stellar moment today, and so climbed two more hills before trying again and finding a better moment for a rescue. The inactive fountain formed part 1, part 2 was the day being more hotterer <em>and</em> more humider than forecasted (Why do I trust them at all?) Between the two... things got ugly again as I became more and more dehydrated. The one person I saw who might have been able to provide some water had a small toddler in tow. She had just coaxed her little one down three large stone steps, was carrying the 19 bags Mom's seem to carry at that point in a child's development and despite my growing certainty about my hydration did not have the heart to ask her to grab her kid and reverse the walk down the stairs, all those bags, ugh. Couldn't do it. It sure makes for a slow trip home though.</p>

<p>That said, there's nothing wrong with a climb that takes me to this:<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/hudson.jpg" alt="hudson river" border="0" width="640" height="336" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-top:9px;" /></p>

<p>I start at about 600ft, drop down all the way to the river and then climb up a shade over 1300ft and then back. The "down to go up" thing can be heartbreaking at times. But it is always achingly beautiful. Sadly, there are cool looking trails that have been closed for a long time that would be fun to bike. (And might eliminate some of the pointless ups and downs.)</p>

<p>I climb with toil, there is no doubt. Allez! (37miles, 3500ft of climbing, one less bottle of water than needed (maybe two)).</p>

This started because because of the appallingly sedentary hours we put in, and its negative effect on our health. The "Ballympics" is not far away, where feats of balance, strength, and prowess will be on display. I'm hoping for at least pictures, if not video...</p>

And just as last year, there was no time for training or specific preparation for the ride. But I did accomplish two things by my steady improvement in a couple of areas.</p>

<p>When teaching I stress the importance of doing the things you're not good at and avoiding the natural tendency to focus on the things that come easy. Since nothing is particularly easy on the bike (for me) this approach generates a lengthy list of issues. I prioritize by which things I do worst, balanced by whichever part of me is working least well. This led me to riding the hills more than ever before. I've learned about my own tempo, and when my IT bands allow, get closer to the edge of heart /lung capacity without blowing up and the like. I can stand and climb for longer than in the past and push that limit deeper than ever before.</p>

<p>And the improvements relate, no doubt, to the second aspect of my continual progress... I've continued to shed pounds. About 15 of them since the same time last year. Everyone who rides knows that the key to climbing is power to weight ratio, and since I don't (and in some ways can't) train with any specificity, weight loss makes an even larger difference.</p>

<p>Hill riding provides me a foundational belief in what I can do, and an understanding that I can reach deeper and more powerfully into myself to produce new levels of performance. I suspect that has greater value than anything else.</p>

<p>Put those three things together and you have someone who cranked out 50 miles in the rain and hail deluge yesterday with out missing a beat. I never had to walk a hill. I never reached a point of "can't" on this route and that was a nice breakthrough for me. And while not in the spirit of the ride, I enjoyed riding past other people on the hills. It's not often I can do that, so forgive me for enjoying myself at others' expense.</p>

<p>I don't know if I'll be back next year, there's other organizations to support and other rides to do, but the Livestrong Philly Challenge has taught me a lot and I appreciate that. I'd like to go back, but it can be a really expensive venture. I would like to complete the 100 miles ride, I think it was doable this year if not for the awful weather.</p>

<p>Last year I turned the Challenge into a marathon of a different sort by traveling down there in the wee hours of Saturday night, meeting Jenni to get my number, going to the venue,  suiting up, and getting on my bike (and then waiting since the event ran late). After a quick start the short steeps beat me into submission and eventually the heat (and the Team Fatty black jersey) finished me off after about 60 miles.</p>

<p>This year we collectively jumped on the room thing, so I was able to go down late Saturday night. The trip was easy, there's no congestion at that hour. Found the Hyatt, where I was given this, after a brief moment with the night clerk:</p>

<img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_00031.jpg" alt="Suite_card_case" border="0" width="640" height="441" />

<p>Lovely. I grab my stuff, find the elevator (about 17 turns from the front Lobby. Seriously? Who designed this place? And it was poorly signed as well.) and head on up. I see the lock turn green, I push the door, and the "don't come in" safety lock is on. I thought briefly of calling someone, and thought I'd try a potentially less intrusive cause-the-door-to-tap-against-lock approach. Jenni noticed and came and opened the lock. Philly Jen and Jenni were still up. A number of topics were discussed, including as <a href="http://epicmoonflower.wordpress.com/2010/08/23/philly-livestrong-2010/">Jenni noted in her story</a> an old fave of mine from the 2001 Ruck in PA. I can't even mention what Philly Jen talked about.</p>

<p>In the lot that morning I said hi to <a href="http://surlyrider.wordpress.com/">Surlyrider</a> and few other folk I met last year. I left for the venue and parked not far from my spot last year, but they had turned the event around, so line up was across the main area. I spotted Jenni making her way, and we lined up toward what we thought would be the front of the 100 mile chute. Little did we know that folks would park themselves in front of us, and then others would start to make their way toward the start line without signal all during the anthem.</p>

<img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/profile.png" alt="philly_challenge_profile" border="0" width="791" height="226" />

<p>Despite all the "Lance is here" stuff, I saw only two bits of him. A portion of his back as he started the ride, and then a glimpse out of the corner of my eye as they bombed down a hill with Liz Kruetz hanging out of the sunroof of the truck and Lance and fellow dudes as they motorpaced right behind. Clearly they had better weather intel than I did... I wondered why they were headed back already and a few minutes later I had my answer.</p>

<p>[You may sneer at Lance and Livestrong (the brand) but you shouldn't sneer at the work being done by everyone else in the organization. The folks standing out in the rain serving drinks and food, the folks on the phone when you call in a panic because of a recent diagnosis. The face of Livestrong has been Lance, but it long ago got away from him as all these people take time to care, support, and love each other and anyone who shows up asking "Help me."]</p>

<p>As the ride got started I got stuck behind a cluster f... er um of folks who were struggling to get moving, and frankly they did not help my cause. Once I got settled, I looked for Jenni up the road, and started to work my way up the outside. We rode along for a bit, and then I turned to say something and there was no Jenni. I turned around and couldn't spot her in the crowd and thought "Hmmm. I've experienced this before." I trusted that she was OK and kept going. I remembered a few bits from last year and have learned a lot about riding in such dense crowds of mixed ability people. In short, I didn't try to ride with anyone, but instead rode in the wind between packs.</p>

<p>I waited at the first rest stop, when it started to rain. I grabbed my jacket out of my pocket, and then Jenni was waiving me on. The stop was poorly signed, so folks were cutting across each other entering and exiting. While I waited the only person who really came close to hitting me was the hipster on the fixie with (wait for it) no brakes. Sigh.</p>

<p>After the first rest stop there's a downhill S curve where someone always seems to overcook. Last year it was a multiple cyclist thing on the first curve, this time it seemed like a white haired gent with a matching beard made a bad decision on the slick second half of the turn. Sad to see an ambulance, but especially so early in the ride.</p>

<p>I had expected a little rain, but not the deluge that got started shortly. I would have brought a bike with tightly sealed hubs, disc brakes, and the like. And very different clothing options. But by the time I hit the 45/70 turnoff I knew it was not a good idea for me to continue heading out. I could deal with the discomfort but not the uncertainty, and really wanted to finish the ride, even if it was shorter than I had expected. Jenni showed and we both turned, and she was already unhappy with the wetness and her brakes. We started down the hill and she and many others decided to walk. I thought if I try and walk I'm bound to slip on my road shoe skates, and felt that as long as I kept them wiping my brakes would be fine (and they were.)</p>

<p>Separated again, I waited at the next rest stop, but was suspicious considering how hard it rained, and how hard the wind blew as I made my way. I saw a SAG car go by, but couldn't see in, and didn't notice Jenni's bike. As I was pulling out I saw her, pulled over, and learned that she had sagged out, but they were making them wait for some other vehicle to come by and get them. She wanted me to stop (it was really pouring again) but it was only just over 15 miles to the finish and I was already soaked, and the bike was still working. I pressed on, and while the soaking continued, I never realized how much hail stings when you ride through it in summer clothing. Now I know.</p>

<p><img style="float:left;margin-right:9px;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img_0002.jpg" alt="unshaven daniel in the morning" border="0" width="240" height="320" />I was handed a laughably small towel at the finish, which was dripping wet by the time I got back to my car. I enjoyed the cheering of folks standing in the rain simply to cheer folks riding in. I was surprised at not to see Jenni there—I didn't learn until long after than she, of course, had gotten back on her bike and finished the ride.</p>

<p>I threw the bike on the car, tossed some towels on the seat, and finally got out of the rain. Just then Rita walked by on her way to some lunch... I still don't know how her ride went. Back at the Suites, I peeled off all the soaked clothes and hopped in the shower. It only took a few minutes to get clean, warm, and dry. Feeling a bit hungry, I rummaged through the leftover stuff from the Fatty barbecue, and found that the hot dog rolls and peach mango salsa were both kosher. I made a salsa dog and enjoyed. I packed up and then checked in with everyone. Jenni told me she finished the ride and was hanging at the finish line welcoming others. I ran into Gene in the parking lot. He was in good spirits. I loaded up and started the long, trafficy trip home.</p>

<p>When I finally got home (insert traffic nightmares here) I threw all my wet stuff into the washing machine including the towels I used to keep the car from soaking up all the water from my clothes. I made some pizza from thin chiabata rolls, sauce and blue cheese and indulged. A little while later it was time for sleep, I had work in the morning. I lost 45 minutes to forgetting to set my alarm clock. I skipped shaving to help move thing along... wound up at work on time but looking like the picture at left.</p>

<p>The good stuff was getting to know Philly Jen a little bit more, riding with Jenni who I haven't ridden with in what seems like ages, saying "hi" to other Fatty's I met last year along the way, and the power of people pulling together. Obvious lows were the weather, the start stop point seemed like a worse choice than last year, and I'll now have to clean and re-grease my bike.</p>

<p>You'd think that I would have known I was going to do this? Nah. 48 miles, 2155 feet of climbing.</p>

<p>I believe it happened because I chose the route that didn't have the "trucks this way" arrow. I now suspect that was a big mistake. I did get to see a motorcycle dude get pulled over for speeding (I presume). Kinda rare thinks I. I also almost got wiped off my bike by cars passing inches away from me about 9 times. What was with everyone today?</p>

<p>Some lovely woman at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Riverside+Deli+newburgh+ny&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=Riverside+Deli&amp;hnear=Newburgh,+NY&amp;cid=15941017776936328557">Riverside Deli and Market</a> filled my bottles with cold water for me <strong><em>despite being closed</em></strong>. She also wished me a good ride. That was awesome! Go buy stuff from them!</p>

<p>The signage to find the walkway across the Newburgh Beacon bridge leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

<p>I meant to ride with the Club today, but I seem to have missed the groups. I can't imagine how I managed that...</p>

<p>It was hot and sunny, and I was exposed far more and later in the day than I usually ride (because I was killing time waiting for the group ride that I missed.) so I'm lightly sunburned. The killer burn sections were the Storm King Mountain climb, the roads in around the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge, and the bridge itself, and a few sections of 9D going home. Sigh.</p>

<p>I dislike cycling gloves that leave strange shaped patterns on the back of my hands. I knew I grabbed the wrong pair the minute I got to where I was going and had no alternatives with me.</p>

<p>Last week pouring rain and hail, this week an overabundance of sun. Such is cycling. Allez!</p>]]></content:encoded>

28 miles, some wrong route mapping and 1400 feet later I arrive back at my car to start the run portion of my training.

All I can say it Hah! You should know better. ;)

Sounds like a nice ride anyway... I'm still not convinced about this running thing... it seems so plodding.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/outdoors/index.ssf/2010/09/the_oregon_stampede_race_provi.html">Lifted in its entirety from OregonLive.com</a>... scroll to the bottom. Below, the photo is by <a href="http://flic.kr/p/5GtV7m">Robert Crum (http://flic.kr/p/5GtV7m)</a></p>

<a href="http://flic.kr/p/5GtV7m"><img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/gravel-road-through-autumn-woods.jpg" alt="Gravel road through autumn woods.jpg" border="0" width="600" height="398" /></a>

<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[BTW, while the long epic gravel grinds are amazing rides, doing shorter, supported gravel road rides are incredibly awesome too. Don't miss out just because there isn't en "epic" ride near you. Find some gravel and go!]</cite>

<p>Ira Ryan, two-time winner of the 300-mile Trans-Iowa gravel road race and Portland bike builder (<a href="http://iraryancycles.com/">iraryancycles.com</a>) has some gravel survival advice for you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bring extra tubes, patch kits and a dependable frame pump that inflates up to 100 psi.</li>
<li>Have good gravel tires (hybrids between road racing and touring tires) that are wider and with a Kevlar puncture strip in the tire casing. They should roll fast with a minimal tread pattern for the smoother sections of road. Maintain near-maximum tire pressure to resist pinch flats.</li> 
<li>Have a comfortable bike. A good gravel bike fits like a comfy road bike but with more clearance for wider tires and a little mud. Cyclocross bikes are a good start. 29ers and other mountain bikes are often overkill unless the gravel turns into single track or gets very rutted.</li>
<li>Be loose on the bike. Gripping the bars and trying to fight the gravel will only result in a crash or sore muscles. If you move your weight back on the saddle, the front wheel will glide over a loose section.</li>
<li>Keep your overall weight down by carrying less and thus decreasing fatigue during a long gravel event. My good friend G. Pickle, who raced in the first Trans-Iowa race, told me to "travel light and freeze at night."</li>
<li>Music can be helpful. It has saved me at 3 a.m. when all I wanted to do was sleep in a ditch. Justin Timberlake and Deelite got me through the third Trans-Iowa. Be sure you can hear traffic.</li>
<li>Stay fueled and hydrated. Dusty gravel makes water that much more important. Don't be afraid to eat a burger for long-burning fuel.</li> 
<li>Stay flexible. Yoga and stretching during and after your ride help a lot by keeping your body from locking up.</li>
<li>Make good lines and use extra power to get through loose gravel. If you steer with your hips, push hard on the pedals from the back of the saddle and use the front wheel as a sort of rudder; you can clean most deep, loose gravel.</li> 
<li> Train and refine your mental stamina for really long gravel races. If you get overwhelmed by the distance of an event, just focus on the here and now of the road. Ride at your own pace, take your time, and keep pedaling.</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/09/the_welcome_to_android">★ Then Welcome to Android</a>: <p>Google vice-president for engineering Vic Gundotra, on-stage at the I/O developer conference in May, <a href="http://www.tomsguide.com/us/Google-Android-Gundotra-Steve-Jobs,news-6875.html">regarding why Google created Android</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Google didn’t act, it faced a draconian future where one
  man, one phone, one carrier were our choice. That’s a future we
  don’t want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skyhook Wireless, in their “complaint and jury demand” filed against Google yesterday (<a href="http://daringfireball.net//misc/2010/09/Skyhook-Google%20Complaint%20and%20Jury%20Demand.pdf">I’m hosting a copy of their entire filing (PDF)</a>, and I highly recommend you read it — it’s not long, and is written in pretty straightforward plain language), regarding Google’s control over which devices have access to the Android Market:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>22. Google’s established practice in determining Android
      compliance consists of two steps. The first step requires each
      Android-enabled device, and its embedded software, to be run
      against the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS), a software-based
      test platform that objectively evaluates whether the device
      and software are compatible with the published Android
      specifications. The second step involves a review of the
      device and software based on an amorphous outline of
      additional, non-standardized requirements known as the
      Compliance Definition Document (CDD). This entirely subjective
      review, conducted solely by Google employees with ultimate
      authority to interpret the scope and meaning of the CDD as
      they see fit, effectively gives Google the ability to
      arbitrarily deem any software, feature or function
      “non-compatible” with the CDD.</p>
  
  <p>23. On information and belief, Google has notified OEMs that they
      will need to use Google Location Service, either as a condition
      of the Android OS-OEM contract or as a condition of the Google
      Apps contract between Google and each OEM. Though Google
      claims the Android OS is open source, by requiring OEMs to use
      Google Location Service, an application that is inextricably
      bundled with the OS level framework, Google is effectively
      creating a closed system with respect to location positioning.
      Google’s manipulation suggests that the true purpose of
      Android is, or has become, to ensure that “no industry player
      can restrict or control the innovations of any other”, unless
      it is Google.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vic Gundotra, at I/O:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you believe in openness, if you believe in choice, if you
  believe in innovation from everyone, then welcome to Android.</p>
</blockquote> <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I've really got nothing to add. It should be no surprise that Google the enterprise acts like an enterprise. Just keep it mind when you use their "free" services. If a service is free, then you are the product. And this applies to all companies. Caveat emptor was never so applicable.]</cite> <br />

<p>Then we built sukkot and handled other chores...</p>
<img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:9px;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/img_0124.jpg" alt="tools in bucket" border="0" width="516" height="600" />

<p>...and the peasants rejoiced (possibly with a bit too much raspberry tort.)</p>
<img style="margin-bottom:9px;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/img_0163.jpg" alt="rasberry tort" border="0" width="320" height="239" />

<p>Some art was framed and hung...</p>
<img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:9px;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/img_0153.jpg" alt="IMG_0153.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="204" />

<p>And some things were noted for later...</p>
<img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-bottom:9px;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/img_0156.jpg" alt="bulletin board" border="0" width="320" height="239" />

<p>Some of the yard was left to overgrow...</p>
<img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:9px;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/img_0223.jpg" alt="overgrown yard with bamboo" border="0" width="600" height="563" />

<p>Then there was more cooking, and as always...</p>
<img style="margin-left:auto;margin-bottom:9px;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/img_0209.jpg" alt="cooking" border="0" width="320" height="239" />

<p>There was more work to do...</p>
<img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-bottom:9px;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/img_0191.jpg" alt="IMG_0191.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="238" />

<p>And so the month has gone. Looking forward to October... now just around the corner.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>My mother's mother was born October 10th, 1910.</p>

<p>It's October, 2010. That's two of three tens. In a few days I'll celebrate her life on the day of her 100th birthday. Sadly, it will be without her.</p>

<p>She reminded each of her grandchildren, in the midst of any conflict, "You be the good one." </p>

<p>Excellent advice for anyone.</p>

<p>Join me next Sunday in this centenary celebration by taking a moment in the midst of whatever you're doing, especially if you are arguing with someone, or on the verge of a conflict, to remember her words, and act on them. You'll be better for it I assure you.</p>

<p>She also made unmatchable tuna salad, and the very best sweet gefilte fish ever. No holiday goes by without our thinking of her.</p>

<p>She was the good one. Always.</p>

<p>Also to my delight, some said they knew because of the <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2010/10/03/10-%e2%80%a2-10-%e2%80%a2-10-you-be-the-good-one/">post</a>.</p>

<p>My father pointed out that his birthday would have an interesting sequence next year, and I later learned that my sister-in-law will have an interesting anniversary sequence the year after.</p>

<p>This is about as far as my numerology will extend.</p>

<p>Maybe just for once, we were all the good ones?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This person's day went to hell fairly early on. Fortunately it only slowed me up a bit getting into the City this morning.</p>

<p>I hope everyone came out of this OK. Sadly, I suspect not considering the level of police activity. But there was still beauty to be found while I waded through an hour of traffic caused only by the extraordinary jackassery called "rubbernecking".</p>

<p>It's not necessary and it wastes a lot of time, gas, and emotional energy.</p>

<p>No plea for sympathy here... if you want to feel bad, feel bad for the folks who were trying to get out of the City who were stopped dead by the accident investigation. Innocent victims to be sure.</p>

<p>Maybe they had good coffee with them? More <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berlinger/sets/72157625155157830/">photos here.</a></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hectic Sunday schedule continues. So another short ride, but going as hard as I can while I'm out there. Shipped the Moots off, long live the Moots. Annual pumpkin patch trip? Check. Hand picked vegetables? Check. Bowls produced by old geezer to keep himself busy? Check. Noah declaring he can't walk another step (yah, sure)? Check. "The mundane is to be cherished."</p>

<p>It's not too late to join me on one of these lovely rides. C'mon out.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[This is important enough to "reprint" in full. Go Fraser! <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search.atom?q=%23ediff">Here's a feed</a> for the #ediff hashtag on twitter]</cite></p>

<div class="entry">
<a href="http://speirs.org/blog/2010/10/19/ipads-curriculum-for-excellence-and-the-next-generation.html">iPads, Curriculum for Excellence and the Next Generation</a>: <p>There's been an incredibly fertile discussion channel on Twitter since last Friday, organised around the hashtag #ediff.</p>

<p>I was working on a presentation about our iPad deployment when Frank Crawford (<a href="http://twitter.com/frankcrawford">@frankcrawford</a>) posted three tweets that chimed almost exactly with the topics I was working into my presentation.</p>

<p>Frank's <a href="http://twitter.com/frankcrawford/status/27848721042">first tweet</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Outcomes for kids - CfE - learning, being confident, contributing, participating. Where does tech contribute?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've been developing a presentation to explain where we see our 1:1 iPad deployment in the light of Curriculum for Excellence. Inspired by Frank's tweets, I'd like to expand on some of the thinking here.</p>

<h3>Successful Learners</h3>

<p>The iPad will not create successful learners by itself. We are finding, however, that the increased relevance of iPad-based teaching is producing increased levels of engagement both in class and with homework and study at home. Engagement is a necessary condition for success but it is not, alone, sufficient.</p>

<p>We often get questions like "well, how do you <em>know</em> your pupils are learning when you teach with the iPad?". The answer, usually, is "the same ways we know  pupils are learning when we teach with textbooks, paper, whiteboards, multiple-choice tests, art materials or newspapers".</p>

<p>What the iPad has allowed us to do is to bring digital resources up to the same level of availabiliy as paper resources in our teaching. It's unthinkable that pupils would only have one or two hours of access to books each week, yet that was the position with digital resources before we deployed the iPad.</p>

<h3>Confident Individuals</h3>

<p>When pupils learn with the iPad, they are learning in their own technological vocabulary. Personal computers - whether Windows or Mac OS X - are not most teenagers' common experience of personal computing.</p>

<p>We find that pupils are incredibly confident in using the iPad and that this feeds into confidence in their work. Our art teacher, Jenny Oakley, recently talked to me about the impact of iPad on her art teaching.</p>

<p>She told me that the iPad forms a kind of "digital safety net":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>In some ways it more effectively helps pupils to develop confidence in their abilities and an enthusiasm to try than some traditional media. This is largely due to the immediacy of its set up, tidy up and effects, the security of an 'undo' button and that mark making is controlled directly by the finger itself.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Pupils do not have to overcome the hindrance of learning to manipulate another tool or implement, rather they can use the natural tool they have been developing dexterity in since birth. Once taught the basic principles of a range of art apps, pupils can achieve worthwhile results. They then begin to feel more confident and so become more willing to try – in the art classroom this is half the battle.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>As a direct follow on from this pupils then do actually begin to achieve better results – their increased confidence increases their effort and enthusiasm and they feel less threatened and more relaxed. This confidence can then be extended and transferred into other art media.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are seeing same impacts in other areas, such as creative writing at all levels from Primary to Higher English, where digital text editing and peer evaluation are producing excellent results.</p>

<p>We are also focusing heavily on presentation skills using Keynote on the iPad. It is my personal belief that Word Processing - setting text on a computer in preparation for printing on paper - is a skill that will wane in value over time. Communicating your ideas to an audience is a skill that is already a clear competitive advantage for those able to do it effectively. Few skills demand the development of confidence like public presenting.</p>

<h3>Effective Contributors</h3>

<p>iPad is removing the friction in contributing. At its simplest, the easy flow of documents to and from the iPad has already transformed our processes of setting and submitting homework.</p>

<p>In class, we are seeing greater collaboration and sharing with iPad. The design of iPad directly lends itself to working together and collaborating - even without specific software support for networked collaboration. The iPad can be handed over to another pupil, turned around to show results and quickly connected to a classroom projector to share work with the entire class.</p>

<p>Compare this to the prior experience of trying to turn a desktop computer monitor around to share your work with someone else, or the experience of three or four pupils huddling around one computer to collaborate.</p>

<p>An example from Computing: we often do exercises where pupils are given a purpose and a budget for buying a computer system and they have to specify a couple of options and recommend one.</p>

<p>In earlier times I, in my "exam conditions" mentality, would often force this to be a solo exercise. Recently, I tried it with paired working with two iPads: one pupil worked the web to find results and the other pupil operated Numbers on their iPad to catalogue what they were finding together. They collaborated on the recommendations then, at the end, emailed me their spreadsheet and CC'ed the web-searching pupil so both had a copy of the shared work.</p>

<p>Each pupil made a solid contribution to the outcome and the results were effortlessly shared.</p>

<h3>Responsible Citizens</h3>

<p>Acting responsibly online is just one (admittedly huge) aspect of the entire citizenship agenda. As a big part of the iPad deployment, we comprehensively reworked our Acceptable Use Policy to make direct references to resources such as social networking as well as the more usual email and web publishing.</p>

<p>Responsible citizenship goes further. By sending iPads home with most pupils, we are giving them access to global sources of information and we're working with that in class. No longer can pupils use the "we don't get the newspaper in our house" excuse for being unaware of current events.</p>

<p>Here's a comment from our Modern Studies teacher, Emma Rukin:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The tasks have become more challenging and worthwhile, as the iPad allows for multi-faceted tasks to be set that combine reading, comprehension, source analysis and internet research in one. Similarly, pupils who require extra support with, for example, a written task, are much happier being emailed a writing frame than being given extra sheets in class.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>The biggest difference I am noticing is that pupils are increasingly suggesting uses for the iPad themselves. In particular, after just a few weeks of iPad 1:1 deployment, pupils are asking if they can use the internet to supplement answers from textbooks, or to find out about particular things that interest or confuse them. In the upper half of secondary pupils have improved dramatically in their ability to find relevant accurate answers using the web. They are improving their ability to frame a question.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>All Modern studies pupils now have access to a wide variety of news sources, meaning their knowledge of current affairs is growing, and their weekly assessments reflect this.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of our English teachers, Rosalind Creighton, sent me this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The S2 class have been analysing some of the articles that have been written about the implementation of iPads in the school. I emailed them a document with links to various articles and questions on each article. This made it much easier for us to read the articles as a class, and saved on photocopying.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>The purpose of this unit of work is to teach children how to assess the reliability and credibility of sources; recognise bias; and understand the techniques writers will use to persuade their readers (all CfE experiences and outcomes!).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd particularly like to thank certain sections of the press for providing Mrs. Creighton with such a, well, broad spectrum of material to work with.</p>

<h3>What Technology Should Be</h3>

<p>Frank also tweeted the following desiderata for the use of technology from a learner's perspective. The tweets are <a href="http://twitter.com/frankcrawford/status/27842879936">here</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/frankcrawford/status/27843158638">here</a> - I've just reformatted them in a list for this blog.</p>

<p>As a learner, technology should be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Everywhere, ready to use.</li>
<li>Easy to use.</li>
<li>Desirable to use.</li>
<li>Challenging my skills.</li>
<li>Sharable</li>
<li>Collaborative</li>
<li>It should play to my passions</li>
<li>Used in useful contexts (from the learner's perspective)</li>
<li>Authentic</li>
</ol>

<p>I believe that point #1 is well placed at the top. We are convinced that the ubiquity of 1:1 deployment is the <em>sine qua non</em> in transforming our learning and teaching. Without 1:1, you lose the sense of personal engagement with a personal device. The pupils' sense of ownership is dramatically diminished.</p>

<p>I don't think I have to make a case to readers of this blog that the iPad is, by any measure, easy and desirable to use.</p>

<p>Making sure that iPad use challenges the skills of a learner is a big question that we are all on a learning curve with right now. I think the whole school staff are only just starting to understand how far we can really push pupils equipped with their own iPad. As readers of this blog can probably tell from the changed tone of my posts over the last few weeks, this is precisely where my thinking is going right now.</p>

<p>I've already discussed the capabilities of the iPad in sharing and collaboration, but one more story: last week, I was accosted in the corridor by two pupil reporters wanting to interview me about iPads for the school newsletter. I was running around fixing wifi base stations and quite busy. Instead of taking me to a classroom where they could formally interview me and type my answers into a computer, we found a couple of seats in the hallway. They pulled out their iPads and we did the interview questions and they took notes on my answers right there and then.</p>

<p>Instant, frictionless, collaboration and sharing using high technology transparently with a strong focus on the actual task of "doing the interview" rather than "doing the interview and recording the answers on the laptops that we have booked for this one afternoon of the week".</p>

<p>We have only given one directive to our teachers for using the iPad: it should be used everywhere it's useful and nowhere that it's not. We did not dictate many specific uses for the device, preferring to leave it to classroom teachers to identify the places where the device will be useful for each subject's unique requirements.</p>

<p>The only specific use we dictated was that everyone should use the Calendar app to record homework. That's a useful context for learners and we're seeing dramatic improvements in homework return rates.</p>

<p>Frank appended a "(yuk)" to the last idea of authenticity but I think there is a point to be made here. I personally believe that pupils - particularly early secondary pupils - crave relevance and authenticity in their learning. I can teach about mainframes and disk drives and everyone's bored. When I facilitate a discussion about why Apple switched from hard drives in the iPod Classic to flash memory in the iPhone, everyone wants to talk about it.</p>

<p>By deploying the iPad in the school and using real-world commercial software instead of "education-specific" clones of real software, we are delivering an authentic experience in school that mirrors and is relevant to the experience of technology that pupils have outside the school and bring to school with them.</p> <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[So there ya go. I've been thinking about how to correct this situation for Noah for weeks now.</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's a number of <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/10/21/willTheMacRemainAnOpenPlat.html">threads</a> about this topic since Apple announced OS X Lion and the app store for Mac. And that definitely changes things... especially if you can run iOS apps on your desktop.</p>

<p>It changes things because of cost. iOS apps, despite their surprising abilities, are less expensive than their desktop equivalents. Since they often seem to work just grandly for people, it makes you wonder whether people haven't been living with bloated, feature crazed software. It also makes you wonder whether a "pro" app, or a development environment will ever be sold through that store.</p>

<p>And it changes things because you give Apple a say of whether your app "qualifies" with all the pain that has caused developers. (Code signing is mess. In the words of the governors race "the pain is too... damn high!"</p>

<p>But what of the long tail effect the store generates? That is, dev's are "gaming" the current store by updating often (leaking the most minor improvements drop by drop) because it brings you to the fore of various marketing efforts. (Think a "recently released" list). It may not be best for their users, but if the only channel to sales is that store then marketing efforts are significantly limited to how people find things in that store.</p>

<p>So far the iOS store seems to generate high sales for the top items and virtually no attention for the vast majority of offerings. First in category, timing, etc. play a large part of this type of sourcing and the tools to find gems hidden in the dust are slim at best.</p>

<p>But that's inside the store. On the Mac there's no reason why other stores couldn't compete, at the moment, although you'd have to find a way to bootstrap that store. But it's not harder than what dev's are doing now.</p>

<p>Let's just be more tasteful than the average Mall though. 'K?</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think the issues with a store are easily addressed in lion, and that apple knows apps are hard to find. I think that's a reason the app store will be it's own app. They didn't announce iTunes 10.3 with app purchases. I envision a way to browse iOS apps, mac apps and books in one place and have them cloud sync via thT big server farm like whisper sync does. 

But the mac, as we know it, is in the beginning of it's final stage. At some point an iOS and mac OS x are going to have to come to terms. Only ttys people who do design really need a desktop OS driven tool. The iPad isn't quite an office machine yet, but most cube farmers only need browser, word proc, email, presentation and spreadsheet. 

When 10.7 comes out I think things like the MacBook air will be more valuable. Think of the enterprise with people using touch powered laptops with small, tightly written apps and cloud storage. the air, I bet will work great running iOS apps in 10.7, so much so that you might forget OS x.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yeah well apps like cs5 and office won't even meet the TOS forthe store, so they're not going to be in there. 

I think the goal isn't to sell mac apps more conveniently, it's to make mac OS x an alternate place to eun your iOS apps. 

Buy a program and run it on the phone, iPad or desktop. Certainly helps their cloud video and music rumored services.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[But there's still large segments that this make's no sense for... Photoshop/Illustrator? AutoCAD (recently returned), Logic Pro? I'm sure there's plenty of others.

It's not that I can't see buying those apps through the app store (download size aside) but that I hope that there's more than one ecosystem. As much as I enjoy Steve's taste in hardware, I know I don't like the code signing process because, frankly it sucks.

And while Steve likes everything integrated... sometimes it's nice to be able to integrate for your circumstances.

So I continue to hope for more than one store... with only one of them controlled by Apple.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little chilly at the start, but a beautiful day for a ride. Sad that I didn't have enough time to grab the Jones and really hit the woods, but thankful for the good weather and chance to give the Kish a workout. It still needs some tuning... but it's almost there.</p>

<p>I posted next weeks ride using the new Rapha Rendevous software (iPhone) as "The Whiners Delight". Interested in trying the software out with a group, but I can't make any of the rides posted as yet. In the meantime... allez!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://www.asymco.com/2010/10/25/the-mac-app-store-can-it-change-the-software-business/">The Mac App Store: can it change the software business?</a>: <p>What is it that makes the iTunes App Store so compelling? Will the value the App store added to the iPhone be added by the Mac App Store to the Mac?<span></span></p>
<p>Here are the characteristics I think make the App Stores valuable:</p>
<ol>
<li>They redefine software as content. The pricing, marketing, discovery and buying process is identical to that for content like music or video.</li>
<li>They redefine the skill required to create a relationship with customers. They allow a new class of less-skilled and less-capitalized developers participate in selling software directly to the buyer. By “skill” I don’t mean engineering skill but marketing skill. A developer can create a product that can reach millions without having to acquire with channels and distribution skills.</li>
<li>From a consumer’s point of view, they simplify purchasing and lower the price of software.</li>
</ol>
<p>These three characteristics of app stores make them disruptive. The disrupted companies are the traditional software publishers. The response from game publishers to the App store were predictable: they condemned it for destroying value, “cheapening” their product, and creating a race to the bottom. They also predicted that it would all end badly as nobody would make any money.</p>
<p>The truth is that they were disrupted by different cost structures. The entrants did not need to spend on market development, and focused on innovating on the essential novelty of the user interface.</p>
<p>So the Mac App Store could be disruptive to traditional software vendors. A large new population of software developers could emerge targeting the Cocoa environment and they may bring new apps that move the jobs that the computer is hired for to appeal to new users.</p>
<p>However there is a problem. The Mac is a small target market relative to iOS. Apple announced that there are 50 million Mac users. This compares badly to the 130 million (or so) iOS users. It won’t be long before 50 million iOS users will be added every three months.</p>
<p>So the first thing that Apple needs to do is grow the Mac installed base. Perhaps the new Air and following updated to the MacBooks will do just that. But the growth rate needs to be an order of magnitude faster. And I suspect price is an obstacle to this growth.</p>
<p>Regardless of this obstacle, the Mac App Store has the potential to change the appeal of the Mac. As the first personal computer with an App Store, new uses may emerge and create the same app-platform effect.</p> <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[All good points.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was so dripping wet at the end of that ride that there was no point in zipping anything up anymore. Too many transitions! ("Hey, it's not raining anymore! Ooops.") More of the story <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2010/08/23/livestrong-philly-challenge-2010/">is here</a>.</p>

<p>The pictures kinda show it, but I remember very clearly being extremely careful about my brake modulation. After a somewhat crazy ride, it would have been a real shame to lockup a wheel and fall in front of all those folks just as I cross the finish line.</p>

<p>The pictures are from Kreutz Photography 'natch.</p>

<p>They're designed for use with road levers and so pull the correct amount of cable, and they work gloriously well. Shuddering is a thing of the past and they're powerful and smooth. As <a href="http://www.trpbrakes.com/category.php?productid=1040&amp;catid=185">TRP</a> says: "The CX9’s linear pull design is compatible with most lever types and provides huge amounts of stopping power." I'd have to agree with the second part, and they work just fine with SRAM Force levers. They're a great improvement over canti's and about $100.00US.</p>

<p>Recommended.</p>

<p>This weekend has not been a healthy one here at Circumstance Manor. Noah started off the cold and whatever cycle, Lisa picked it up and has been hacking away and feeling achy for days, and what started off as a few twinges in my stomach over the course of the week became a full blown nightmare.</p>

<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Queasy folk should bail now.]</cite>

<p>Friday morning's breakfast caused some mild distress, but the day had already been complicated by Noah hurling at school, causing Lisa to have to turn around, pick him up, and drop him off at his Grandparents' house for as brief a time as possible.</p>

<img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img_0337.jpg" alt="IMG_0337.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="239" style="float:left;margin-right:9px;" />

<p>I thought nothing more of it, despite the continuing ache, until it started to get worse as the day wore on. My abdomen really ached by mid afternoon, and felt rigid and distended. By the early evening I was feverish, dizzy, and shortly after, feeling very flush and finally hurling whatever was still inside.</p>

<p>Although generally one feels better after that, I didn't. Despite the early hour I climbed into bed, and tried to rest. I woke at 1am to continued pain, that flushed fever thing, and a general feeling of "here it comes again" although it turned out not to be the case. Next time I woke up a few hours later things had taken a different direction... but the ache was gone.</p>

<p>Not having eaten much on Friday, I was good and dehydrated by the time I woke up again, and I gently and carefully began rehydrating. When things felt more stable I had just a bit to eat. That went well too. So now other than general weakness and some achiness, I seemed to be on the mend.</p>

<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Queasy folk can resume here.]</cite>

<p>Having conquered the basics once again, I attempted to keep things moving toward health by going for my ride this morning. I had nothing and knew it before I cranked the pedals once... and essentially rode 4mph slower over the same route as the previous week. But other than the forgivable weakness it was a nice ride. I dressed warmly hoping to be both comfortable and to sweat out some more of the poison. It was cool and breezy out, but otherwise lovely, and other than my hands which were a bit cool, I was comfortable. I had forgotten how much winter tights add to each leg lift.</p>

<p>I had put <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2008/06/04/jack-brown-greens-a-little-hampsten-for-my-commute/">Jack Brown Green's</a> on my bike since the last ride and they were loverly as always. I did notice something that feels like a poorly adjusted headset which I'll have to have looked at. I had also changed pedals to make wearing mountain bike shoes easier. Winter is coming afterall...</p>

<p>I'll have to take it easy this week to enable recovery rather than running myself into the ground.</p><img src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/img_0345.jpg" alt="IMG_0345.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="239" style="float:right;" />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Made of wonderfully soft organic cotton knit, the Limited Edition Fall Peloton scarf is a colorful way for me to celebrate fall cycling even when I'm not on my bike. There's a special message printed on the fold, and is the first in a series of special editions from <a href="http://www.vividexcellence.com">VividExcellence</a>.</p>

<p>If you want one (and you know you do) you can send mail to "daniel.berlinger+scarf.sample" at gmail dot com. If there's enough interest a run will be produced, so tell your friends.</p>

<p>If a run is to be produced, I will contact you with pricing information, and you will have the opportunity to place an order.</p>

<p>If nothing else, I'm lovin' it.</p>

Just found your blog (again) and wanted to say hello.  Sounds like you're well and happy. I think that's great. Ginny and I "may" have settled down due to my medical problems.  But I wouldn't bet on that. Still have this terrible wanderlust to contend with.   

Keep on cycling,

I'm glad you took a moment to get in touch. I was just quoting you the other day, as more folks are getting into "bike packing" and discovering the lessons already learned by the thru-hiker crowd.

As for well and happy, thankfully I certainly am, and despite whatever problems you allude to above, I hope both of you are as well.

We should "really" catch up. Are you on the East coast?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wind was relentless today. And because my outdoor thermometer broke a few weeks ago, I have a much poorer sense of how cold it is outside. I used too little glove, so my hands were painfully cold at times, and I could've used hotter embro on my partially exposed legs. I also didn't drink enough, and so all put together I got a couple of near cramps, but I managed to work past them.</p>

<p>It was the longest ride I've done in a while, with 2168ft of climbing, because we've been super busy lately... but I knew that folks and Team Fatty members specifically were running the NYC Marathon today, and I used them for motivation.</p>

<p>I only took a couple of pics because stopping was not helpful and my hands were too cold to take my gloves off more than once or twice, but these two capture the sense of the day, cold, clear, and bright. They don't capture the cold and wind.</p>

<p><a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/06/howObamaCouldHaveAvoidedTh.html">How Obama could have avoided the shellacking</a>:He wouldn't have been up against the Republicans if, on coming into office, he set up a Craigslist for volunteering, with meetups at a community level every month to talk about ways of making things work better. And during the rest of the time, no talk, just action. Keep the streets clean. Help out the homeless. Create new flows of information about how things are working, or not.</p>

<p> I think he had that opportunity, to carry the new way his campaign lifted him up and use the same energy to lift up everything. At least then, if it failed, it wouldn't have been his faillure, it would have been ours. But he didn't even try. Not even a bit. </p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Dave nailed it above. The change I can believe in is the ability to crowd source things. You see the effect on EBay and Twitter and Facebook. It's the change that Obama should've created and hasn't. The opportunity is not lost.]</cite> <br />

<blockquote>Given that he had a clean history, Mr. Erzinger would essentially have been able to write a check, and the case would then be dismissed. On top of that, while Dr. Milo was still probably recovering from his injuries, Mr. Erzinger would be able to say that he had no criminal history and even deny that anything had happened. That is not something I could stomach.

I therefore offered that Mr. Erzinger plead guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and careless driving causing serious bodily injury. 

This means that for the rest of his life, Mr. Erzinger will have on his record that he carelessly drove, caused another human being serious bodily injury and left the scene. He will lose his driver's license, face potential jail time as determined by the judge and still have to pay restitution, which as I said in the Vail Daily is important to us but not an overriding objective in the plea.</blockquote>

Not bad. +1]</cite>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm going to talk about "content" for a minute. I'm going to define it as stuff I read. And what I realized is that going back to my earliest days of the web, I don’t consume content. I use it to support my writing, which is really an ongoing conversation with my friends.</p>

<p>In the final analysis we’re all media outlets now. </p>

<p>So my writing and thoughts (and yours as well) move from friend to friend through the social network, far from the original source of the story. Sources of stories that are shareable are preferable because I can weave them into my thoughts, display the context of my thinking, and minimize, in a shorthand kind of way, how much writing I need to do. And because linking is so important, a shareable amateur source is preferable to a professional source that requires me to pay, or worse, requires everyone to pay.</p>

<p>Someone who reports a car accident with a few cell snaps is doing a far better job than the person who picks up a report off the police blotter. Someone who visits the family and reports on how things are going is doing a far better job than someone who gets the "patient is stable" report from the hospital. What matters it turns out is not publishing, which has become easy at even a world wide level, but reporting, analysis, and story telling.</p>

<p>We should be talking about new models for employing reporters, photographers, authors, and story tellers of every sort, and not publishing. Publishing has already moved on...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50834669@N00/5175926716" title="View 'Pano of Route 6 Lake' on Flickr.com"><img height="83" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" alt="Pano of Route 6 Lake" border="0" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4110/5175926716_4235e3cea4.jpg" width="500" /></a>

<p style="text-align:center;">Waaaaay to much climbing today. What was I thinking? No regrets! Much better glove choice today, besides it was warmer. Still, that was a midsummer climbing route... time to ease off a bit thinks I. Felt OK though. Allez!</p>

<p><a href="http://quietlybrilliant.biz/images/sunday_hill_climb_11_14.png">Route notes</a>: Out the door to Camp Hill Road up and over to Call Hallow Road. Left onto Willow Grove. Right on Blanchard (Co Rd 98). Right on Gate Hill Road (Rockland County 106), Left onto Cedar Flats Road, Left onto Mott Farm Road. Sharp Left onto Liberty Drive down to 9W. left on 9W. Slight left onto S Entrance Road (7 Lakes Drive), past Perkins down to the Route 6 interchange and circle, keep going on 7 Seven Lakes Drive (another long climb), switch sides of the road to avoid the crazed racoon. Left up Tiorati Brook Road which becomes Cedar Pond Road. Loop around onto Lake Welch Parkway and slog back up to Lake Welch, squeeze by the closure, and enjoy the empty Lake. Jump on the double track that leads to the boat launch or stay on the road as you wish (just guess which choice I took?). Hang a left on Gate Hill Road (RC106 again, now from the other side) and bomb down Gate Hill Road. Now reverse the beginning of the ride, up Call Hallow, up Camp Hill, and shortly you're back.</p>

<p>Variations, you can stay on 7 Lakes Drive and climb up and over from Kanawauke Circle. You can continue even further up 7LD turn left on Lake Welch Pkwy and make a right on Johnstown Road past the Church in the Woods.  I have an even more epic version planned for the summer... let me know if you want in... should be a fun day.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is with small bits that many projects start. Beautifully machined little critters are they not? More on these later...</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50834669@N00/5192771993" title="View 'IMG_2067' on Flickr.com"><img height="" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" alt="IMG_2067" border="0" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4088/5192771993_bcb85350e5_b.jpg" width="" /></a>

<p>Recycled cotton, and touch of stretchy stuff. Not made to match, plenty of colors. Joy.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50834669@N00/5183871237" title="View 'IMG_0371' on Flickr.com"><img height="500" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:9px;" alt="IMG_0371" border="0" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1037/5183871237_2f6e162683.jpg" width="374" /></a>

<p>No pics from today's ride. It was cold and brief. I lacked motivation today... too much to do off the bike. I did clean my mountain bike, and gave it a spin. Changed the saddle too. Tried to change the gears out, but the alt gears hit the spokes and I don't have an appropriately sized spacer. Added to the todo list. I have to trim the steerer tube as well. Noted.</p>

<img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/img_1337.jpg" alt="IMG_1337.JPG" border="0" width="600" height="400" />

<p>Hinge on mailbox door breaks. I think about just sticking a pin in there and calling it a day. Second hinge is on its last legs, lots of rust everywhere as well. Ah well. Oh look, the post is loose and leaning over. Naturally, there isn't a lick of concrete pier anywhere to be seen. Post is rotting. Track down a new mailbox (wow, mailboxen are 'spensive). Magazine holder and new post also. Since winter is coming, I'm not getting involved in a pier, plus, I'd really like to move the darn thing. It was placed with this stupid assumption about stopping with the car hanging half into the street while you hop out and get the mail... if I did it it would be a great way to get the car totaled or myself killed. Box should be moved to the non-existent front walk. Why no walk? Easy. Who would ever do anything but get into their car? Walking? What am I nuts? At this point I'm simply hoping not to annoy the postal folk... bolting, mounting, temp plywood, and some stones are in order.</p>

<p>Can't believe how many bulbs I've been replacing lately. Considering I try *not* to use incandescent bulbs this is getting very expensive. And some of the fixtures are a pain to change. Noted for the next remodel project if or when...</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got up early and did 30 fairly chilly miles with Gerry. He'll soon torture me with tales of 80 degree days in Florida, but he was thankful to note that I was riding on fat 33's while he ridin' skinnies. I believe I pedaled twice as much as he to cover the same distance. Then, like most of the US it seems, the pilgrims living at Circumstance Manor turned to the kitchen and produced a scrumptious feast. You can see some of it below...</p>

<p>The abundant feast could well be the item lowest on the "thankful" list. We are overwhelmingly blessed. "Better than I deserve" is how I feel most of the time.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"I have come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive element. It is my personal approach that creates the climate. It is my daily mood that makes the weather. I possess tremendous power to make life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration, I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal. In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated or de-escalated, and a person is humanized or de-humanized. If we treat people as they are, we make them worse. If we treat people as they ought to be, we help them become what they are capable of becoming.”</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<p style="text-align:center;">In an unrelated note... this years Chanuka treats. Both were keepers!</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50834669@N00/5240710269" title="View 'http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5088/5240710269_019bf23382.jpg' on Flickr.com"><img height="349" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:9px;" alt="marshmallow and chocolate dreidels" border="0" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5088/5240710269_019bf23382.jpg" width="500" /></a>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50834669@N00/5241304996" title="View 'http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5121/5241304996_6dd1a1f9b7.jpg' on Flickr.com"><img height="500" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" alt="Chocolate toffee pecan squares" border="0" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5121/5241304996_6dd1a1f9b7.jpg" width="398" /></a>

<p>The above is based on <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2010/12/cleta-baileys-toffee-squares/">these</a>, but I used <a href="http://www.ghirardelli.com/products/chips_bittersweet.aspx">60% Cacao Bittersweet Chips</a> from Ghirardelli despite this being a first time, we almost always think these things are too sweet. I might go even darker next time. I also sprinkled Heath bits English Toffee Chips and left the lovely pecans whole. Squares were cut around the pecans. Changes for next time: We'll take some of the sugar out of the dough, bake it a bit more, and flatten it more. I also put them in the fridge, since the chocolate seemed a touch excessive and wasn't setting up (fast enough for me and the late hour when I made these). After I chucked it in the fridge the chocolate set up in a few minutes. Then they sliced up nicely.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Letting go</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an <a href="http://www.embrocationmagazine.com/online/customs">article</a> about trusting a builder to do what they do. We all love to apply the hard won knowledge we gain, and we all love to have things that are *just* what we want. There's only one way to get that, and that is build, sew, weld, weave, and stack the work yourself. 'Cause short of that it is a collaboration and the platonic plane of your projects existence is forever lost in that collaboration. Instead you jiggle the elbow of your partner about what they're building and how. Craftsman bring there own experiences to project. What they like and dislike. What's worked for them and what hasn't. What they've had time to try and what they haven't. You can find folks who will experiment on your dime, but you best have enough dimes to not be upset when the experiments fail. And if *my* experience tells me anything, it's that more things fail than succeed. Either way it devolves the purity of the what you want to produce.</p>

<p>Find a builder of whatever who builds stuff you like and then having it tailored to you. It'll be sized for you. You'll discuss the qualities that are important to you. But if you really want to specify tube thickness and stay length you're probably wasting your time and the craftsman's. If you want to argue, argue over fit, where only you can say what's comfortable. But in the end, you'd better off building your own, take the plunge, you'll have fun!</p>

<p>The same problem exists in the software world. One of the hardest parts of working as a consultant was getting a business owner to trust you with the mechanics. Software is so scary ("Every project costs a fortune! They're all late! I don't understand what's going on!") for many business owners. Still, the mechanics of how data is stored, for example, is not what you should spend time discussing no matter how much the business owner thinks they know. How the software impacts the business, who would be using it and how, and other *real* requirements is where the crux of the biscuit lies. Sure, they may want to know why you're doing what you're doing, and you should explain. But chances are, unless there are far larger misunderstandings, that detail is not the one that makes or breaks the deal.</p>

<p>I read the blogs of a lot of tradesfolk. Builders of houses, bikes, cars, jewelry, clothes, and of course software. And they generally agree. Some limit people's tendencies along these lines by only releasing their own designs. Other apply varying techniques, and some deal with building what you want and you not being happy. But no matter how they approach the business aspect, they all dream about having steady work, happy clients, and the chance to do what they know how to do.</p>

<p>My advice is to let folks do what they do. Find people trustworthy and then trust them. Don't hire folks with whom you feel the need to oversee every detail. It can only work if overseeing that project is *your* full time job, and even then it could well not. If it isn't your full time job then chances are it will consume every spare cycle you have and still leave you with all sorts of things you don't like, didn't want, and that cost you dearly. A far happier path is letting go, and trusting that you did a good job finding someone. Most of us are good at finding people we like. Inform them, work with them, show them examples. Talk about things other than your project and show them stuff you like in general. And if you like the decisions they've made elsewhere let them know. Design together. Talk through the ideas. Now let go, and let them do their job. It's what you pay them for in the end.</p>

<p>I've done this successfully this year. And I'm trying it again right now. It is a work in progress so I won't speak to it yet. But I will, success or failure, when it's done.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The magnitude and ferocity of this storm is hard to describe. It started gently enough, but as we hit the main portion of the storm, it snowed as hard as I've seen it. It left five foot drifts in the back yard and the similar in the driveway. The strongly whipping winds piled snow high in some places, and left almost nothing elsewhere. The trees lining the driveway left a wind protected walkway that was very useful. The crows enjoyed the feast left on the ground from the winds. The next morning, the storm was still clearing out.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheSecretDiaryOfSteveJobs/~3/aLzao7Ocghk/my-talk-with-a-left-wing-hack.html">The Secret Diary Of Steve Jobs</a>:
 
<blockquote>...much of what we call “news” is really entertainment, and entertainment of the worst sort. Beck, O’Reilly, Limbaugh, Olbermann, Ed Schultz. It’s not right or left. It’s both. It’s shouting, and name-calling, and demonization, and it’s all fun and games until someone gets shot.

As for the Internet, let’s just be honest: Much of what we now call “news” online isn’t even entertainment, it’s garbage.

There. I said it.

It’s garbage precisely because online news sites are not primarily created to report news. They’re created to make money. Problem is, it’s nearly impossible to make money doing what they do. So they resort to ever more desperate tricks.</blockquote>

<p>or put another way</p>

<blockquote>“needing some air, he went into the garden.
‘ah, look at the afternoon light,’ he said,
for shadows were forming dark zones
in the pasture recesses,
as they do in his masterpiece,
‘the mountain.’

he went over to a small shed
in the corner of the garden,
the back wall of which was made of 
finely carved wood shingles
arranged in a design.

‘you see,’ he said, ‘the trouble they took
for something that could not even be seen. 
that is what has been lost.  it was lost
when workers began selling their time.
or as you say in america,
when time became money.’ ”</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/winter_cyclist_86_700x454.png" alt="winter_cyclist_86_700x454.png" border="0" width="600" height="389" />

<p>Way back in the day Jenni didn't ride in the cold. Nope she packed it in, whined about the cold, and refused to budge. But how could she refuse a birthday celebration ride? Years later I think she's <a href="http://epicmoonflower.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/daniels-great-annual-birthday-ride/">captured the essence of the day</a> and ride rather well. And is no longer the "ice pansy" she used to call herself.</p>

<p>We've ridden in sleet and rain without knowing where we were. We've ridden on an ice riddled bike path when it was so cold that everyone gave in and just wore their winter coats. Doing even 4 miles seemed like insanity on that ice without skates. Last year I did a version of this route as I planned to ride it a lot—seemed like a fitting way to start the season.</p>

<p>The route goes up for a while, but we were in no rush, and it gentles at times to give you a break. I admit though, that this ride and I became good friends over the last year as was my plan. It was part of my "go to" ride, so I might not have thought about Jenni's reaction to it (she did it with me at least once last year) until I heard some world class whining coming from just behind. Not, I should say, that she needs impetus for world class whining, but she was in truly rare form. I admit it rendered me speechless. I say that with no disrespect for my own champion level ability to whine, but she really took it to another level. Well done!</p>

<p>The day was a clean, clear winter's day. Everything was bright and sparkling. Bright sun. Deep blue skies. Cold, but not overwhelmingly so, and the wind was a reasonable 9MPH. After riding on nothing but fat tires for the last few months I dropped some skinnies on the Kish and was delighted by the easy roll. And I was comfortable on the hills despite the seemingly inevitable winter weight gain. (I tried, I failed, Allez!)</p>

<p>But this ride is never about "cycling". It's about getting out on my bike in January regardless of the conditions and feeling the joy of life. Meant in the best of ways, I never laugh more than when I ride with Jenni.</p>

<p>Yes, it's true, I took no pictures because I didn't want to stop to un-glove, get cold etc. And maybe one day I'll miss the evidence of this ride. But for now, the sunlight, the pink bike, the whirring of carbon laden tights, and the laughter are as totally clear as the air we breathed.</p>

<p>It is a natural reaction to stop and retrieve an ejected item... a light, a bottle, a speedo. Sometimes because you need the drink, bike comps are not inexpensive, you want to remain visible... all valid reasons. But it's easy to be hypoxic, or distracted enough as you're turning around to forget that you're still traffic.</p>

<p>Sadly that seems to have happened to 23 year old <a href="http://www.dailypeloton.com/displayarticle.asp?pk=18063">Carla Swart</a> today while doing intervals. RIP, and the best to her family, friends, and teammates.</p>

<p>I'd notice this "suspension of attention" a while back and made it a rule for myself that I'd get off my bike, and walk back to retrieve whatever fell. It's enough of a break to help prevent this failure. Even having the rule is  a help, because at times I have turned around and ridden back, but not without having to think "Hey, you're supposed to walk it back..." which reminds me why I have the rule in the first place and helps keep me safe.</p>

<p>I hope it'll help you too.</p>

<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[As an aside, my road bike position seems to offer up gobs of toe overlap, so "hangin' that u'ey" is ripe with opportunity to flop over. Yet another reason to think twice before I attempt that little wonder...]</cite>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I  was working on a longish piece about the "helmet good/helmet bad", "wear one/don't wear one" thing.</p>

<p>Sparked by this <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/caps">piece</a> and then compounded by <a href="http://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/fear-of-yellow">this</a>, where he writes of <a href="http://alancolville.org/2011/02/in-the-saddle/">Alan Colville’s</a> disaster.</p>

<p>But I've decided not to because a lot of these things are over thought, and over wrought.</p>

<p>I dig cycling caps. I love riding without a helmet. I almost never do it anymore, but there are times when I do. And maybe the helmet will help me out one day, or maybe it'll never make a difference or worse. Growing up, no one rode with a helmet, certainly not I. Now everyone does. Sometimes, I don't want to, but mostly I do.</p>

<p>What changed my mind about writing about this in more depth were pictures I saw from around the world where folks were riding with various helmets, hats, nothing, watch caps, etc. and everyone was managing. The only unifying thread was that they were all on bikes, doing their thing.</p>

<p>So do what you think is right, and let's stop turning these things into more than they are.</p>

<p>Be safe.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a few seconds ago it was February. Now it's April. What the...!</p>

<p>I started writing this yesterday morning, but well, that's exactly how things have been going. It's been busy, happy, troubling, joyous, and filled with code. Lots of work. Plenty of Noah time (yay!). Not enough time with Lisa (boo!). A small amount of riding around the edges.</p>

<p>On the tech side, I've been digging more deeply into <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>. A wonderful tool added to my kit over the last year. I still feel like I'm just grazing the surface here.</p>

<p>After many years (not since her wedding?) I had a chance to grab lunch with Lynn, a friend since college. Unbeknownst to either of us, that was a Long Time Ago™. Really nice to see her. <img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-top:9px;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/lynn_and_me.jpg" alt="lynn and me" border="0" width="300" height="225" /></p>

<p>More soon. I've got two really cool rides coming up.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Busy Developers Guide: CoffeeScript</title>
		<link>http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2011/05/03/busy-developers-guide-coffeescript/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Please note that these instructions are for busy developers, and assume that you are one. If so, this should help, if you're not, these may not. Sorry about that. Below are the steps I used...</p>
<ol>
<li>First get <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a> (the node package manager).</li>
<li>You'll find a one line install such as this or similar: <code>curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh</code></li>
<li>Next CoffeeScript: <code>npm install -g coffee-script</code> (Leave off the -g if you don't wish to install globally.)</li>
<li>Assuming that went well you should be able to type "coffee" on the command line and see a <code>"coffee&gt;"</code> prompt.</li>
<li>Pat yourself on the back and start developing! But wait, a little more structure might help... You can skip the steps below and <a href="https://github.com/danielberlinger/learning_coffeescript">check out the repository.</a></li>
<li>Create a new folder and get it set up as a repository. For me that looks something like this: <code>mkdir ~/code/learning_coffeescript; cd ~/code/learning_coffeescript; git init;</code></li>
<li>Create some files a bit of structure. A top level public directory and src directory. Inside public I created a lib dir and an index.html file.</li>
<li>The index.html file contains a base html 5 template, and in my learning case it included a line pointing to the hosted jquery.js lib, and our newly compiled javascript file (yeah, I know, patience... I'll get to it in a minute.)</li>
<li>Back in the terminal, at your project root, type <code>coffee -o public/lib -cw src</code> which will compile all the CoffeScript files written in src into javascript in lib. It is "watching" the src files timestamps so if you update and save a file it will recompile.</li>
<li>Assuming you've got everything wired up correctly, you can fire up a browser, open the index.html file and go to town.</li>
<li>If you want to get snazzy you can <code>rackup file_server.ru -p 1111</code> and the project will run under a basic Rack file server.</li>
<li>If you wish to be all hip and edgy you can download and install <a href="http://pow.cx/">Pow</a>, symlink your local clone of the <a href="https://github.com/danielberlinger/learning_coffeescript">repository</a> and develop to your hearts content.</li>
</ol>

<p>Feel free to make pull requests, or send me issues, updates, or notes. I'm sure I have a lot to learn about CoffeeScript how best to integrate it with jQuery, etc. In the end though, I'm enjoying the syntax. It was just not clear how to get a project going. Next I'll be looking at testing...</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last few years one of the annual rights of spring has been to raise money for charity by doing something ridiculous on my bike... namely riding some crazy distance in very small circles. Yesterday's circle was a 1/4 mile... round and round at the Kissena Park Velodrome in Queens.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50834669@N00/5804175558" title="View 'Kissena Park Velodrome' on Flickr.com"><img height="411" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" alt="Kissena Park Velodrome" border="0" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5109/5804175558_1eca19f38b.jpg" width="500" /></a>

<p>Though serious looking at the start, with early laps and other athletic looking gestures made, the hilarity was not far behind. First we were buzzed by the locals who happen to get out early and fly their radio controlled airplanes, helicopters, and whatnot, doing loops and aerobatics not far over our heads. The wind, which became a constant companion started to create the  home straight headwind. And the track was far bumpier than I would have thought a track would be, except this is a public park, in NYC, and so I should have known better.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50834669@N00/5803645141" title="View 'Carlos and Jamieson warming up' on Flickr.com"><img height="374" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" alt="Carlos and Jamieson warming up" border="0" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5106/5803645141_f6806f36b5.jpg" width="500" /></a>

<p>There were piles of food (this was Team Fatty event afterall) and enough spare tires, tubes, pumps, water, etc. to keep a small race team in good shape for a half a season.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50834669@N00/5803656755" title="View 'Round 'n round' on Flickr.com"><img height="374" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" alt="Round 'n round" border="0" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3452/5803656755_1e1172393a.jpg" width="500" /></a>

<p>So in typical Team Fatty fashion, there was joy, and unending laughs, and the insanity of riding (in my case) a metric century in 1/4 mile circles (I did 250 laps...)</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No really. I was.</p>

<p>I was up early and out the door. My hands hurt form the cold on the run down 202 to Route 17. The climb up to Mountainview felt good. The quiet, sun, general peacefulness did my head and heart good. I passed the giant mountains of organic waste composting away, amazed at the height of the piles.</p>

<p>I turned the corner onto 17a feeling good. It's a been a crappy season overall. I haven't coordinated my riding very well. Never found the pocket. Each ride is a struggle to get out the door, and none of the things I wished to do have been done. It goes that way sometimes. I can let things go. Breathe.</p>

<p>This morning I was the breakaway. Out front, nose in the wind. Making my way. The peloton of worries and concerns was not far behind and chasing hard. But whatever inevitable catch was waiting me, for now I was off the front. The time, the wind, the sunshine, the birds, and views  were all mine.</p>

<p>I hit the backside of Harriman and the long climb up from the valley. My knees took turns hurting, but remained manageable. I have the the final bit of climbing almost in sight when I hear a now familiar sound of a spoke breaking. I pull over, off the road, I hold up my hand. Nothing. There's never a team car when you need one. Wait... who's this? An old guy in a green truck pulls up. "You gotta problem?" Yes.  A broken spoke. "Can't help you with no spokes." Thinking to myself... Offering me a ride was prolly not on your morning to do list. But it was fun to think that holding my hand up caused him to stop in the first place.</p>

<p>Since it was the front wheel this time I decided to wind the spoke around another and remove the brake pad holders to give the untrue wheel room to rotate. Sure, I could have made "The Phone Call", but that sucks for everyone and it was only about 12 miles to home. Riding slowly and gently I made my way up the rest of the hill to the next circle.</p>

<p>Ran in to a frightfully cheery Aussie who was way too fit, asking about the road I just rode up. He seemed delighted that it went through to 17, and that it was essentially downhill all the way. His happy mood was not a match for mine at the moment.</p>

<p>As I tackled the last climb I realized sadly that I was going to miss out on the downhill. Not only would I have to work to keep my speed down on the gentle slopes, but the real plummet down into the valley would be crazy reckless on a weak and wobbling wheel and no front brakes. Imagine the ignominy of clomping <strong>down</strong> a hill. Oh agony, agony.</p>

<p>I finished up about 25 minutes later than I thought I would, happy that I hadn't collapsed the wheel riding home and ruined anything else. Some small pride that I finished what I started.
</p>
<p>I thought of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sethdill/status/90118742926835712">Seth</a> while all this was going on. He had a run in with a car at 25mph and who's now working on replacing his bike (and that is no picnic for someone as tall as he) and glad for him that nothing really bad happened to him, just his bike.</p>

<p>All the crashing in Le Tour this year makes me concerned. But then I go for a ride...</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/08/macbookair">Traveling With the MacBook Air</a>: <p>On my way home from the UK last month, I posted about my <a href="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/07/dream">dream to travel light</a>. As it turns out, I didn’t wait too long to start implementing it. I haven’t picked up an X100—though I have been frequently checking the various camera stores. I have, however, acquired a 13" MacBook Air and have been using it as my only computer for the last week while on a trip to New York.</p>

<div><img src="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/08/macbookair_500w.jpg" width="500" height="333"><div style="width:500px;">My 13" MacBook Air in flight on CO 1585 from Newark NJ to Portland OR.</div></div>


<p>As a general-purpose laptop, the new MacBook Air is as awesome as everyone says it is. Lightweight, surprisingly speedy, and gifted with impressive battery life, Apple’s marketing is dead on. It is the perfect everyday laptop for most users. But what about for using it for something more demanding? More to the point, the question you probably have for me is: How well does it work as a laptop for a photographer?</p>

<p>The answer is that as long as you can live with its limitations, it’s a surprisingly decent travel photography laptop. I’ve totally enjoyed it while working on planes and trains and in cafés. It’s done everything I’ve asked it to since I bought it, including working through my photos and posting a <a href="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/08/ord_departure">few</a> <a href="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/08/ewr_approach">along</a> <a href="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/08/westbeth">the</a> <a href="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/08/followme">way</a>. I even used it for light client work while in New York where I needed to quickly shoot a few dozen images and then deliver a finished photo on the spot.</p>

<p>So what are the limitations of the Air? One is the lack of a discrete GPU. This affects applications that can take advantage of it, like Aperture. In my experience so far, it’s most noticeable when importing a big set of photographs and waiting for the initial churn of preview generation to finish. Also, judicious use of Preview mode is called for when browsing photos. If you’re using Lightroom or other applications which only hit the CPU, however, you won’t miss out on the acceleration you didn’t have to begin with.</p>

<p>Another limitation is the speed at which you can get data on and off the MacBook Air. Without using a Thunderbolt display or a huge <a href="http://www.promise.com/storage/raid_series.aspx?region=en-US&amp;m=574&amp;rsn1=40&amp;rsn3=47&amp;statistic=pegasus">Promise Pegasus disk array</a>, the current choices are USB 2.0 or WiFi. This means a bit of patience is required whenever you’re making big data transfers, such as to push a big set of photos from the laptop to desktop once you get home after a trip. This limitation should ease as more Thunderbolt options arrive—I really would like a Thunderbolt port expander with Gigabit Ethernet and FireWire on it—but that will take time. For now, it’s a bottleneck that has to be dealt with.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that if you need a single computer for your photography and it has to be a laptop, you really should be looking at the 15" MacBook Pro. The quad-core CPU, the discrete and fast GPU, the ability to use 8GB of RAM, and the external port options are all extremely useful on a primary photography workstation. On the other hand, if you have an iMac or Mac Pro where you do the bulk of your photo processing, the MacBook Air serves as a great lightweight companion to take on the road. And for all those non-photographic things you do while traveling—email, web browsing, writing—the Air is a shining star that’s a joy to use.</p>

</p> <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I have nothing to add. He's right on the money. Photography is not a main use, but if you insert almost any other processor intensive task, it applies. The Air is a great general purpose machine that is good enough to squeak by on "Pro" tasks, but you'll need a MBP for day in day out work… at least until companies start churning out Thunderbolt based extenders.]</cite> <br />

<p>Let's see this modularity first hand by building up a CarrierWave uploader from scratch.</p>
<p>To begin with, we'll install CarrierWave:</p>
<pre>  gem install carrierwave
</pre>
<p>Then, we can make the world's shortest uploader:</p>
<pre>  require &#039;carrierwave&#039;

  class MyUploader &lt; CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
    storage :file
  end
</pre>
<p>Even at this point, we can start saving files:</p>
<pre>  file = File.open('example.jpg')
  uploader = MyUploader.new
  uploader.store!(file)
</pre>

<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/08/resigned">★ Resigned</a>: Zoom out enough and you can see that the same things that define Apple’s products apply to Apple as a whole. The company itself is Apple-like. The same thought, care, and painstaking attention to detail that Steve Jobs brought to questions like “How should a computer work?”, “How should a phone work?”, “How should we buy music and apps in the digital age?” he also brought to the most important question: “How should a company that creates such things function?” <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[It's a sad day for anyone who loves the craft of technology and a vision of technology "that just works".]</cite> <br />

<p>Joining other <a title="reactions" href="http://9to5mac.com/2011/08/24/reactions-from-around-the-web-on-jobs-resignation/">reactions</a> on the web to Steve Jobs’ <a title="sudden resignation" href="http://9to5mac.com/2011/08/24/steve-jobs-resigns-as-ceo-of-apple/">sudden resignation</a> as the CEO of Apple yesterday, Google’s vice president of engineering Vic Gundotra <a title="recalled" href="https://plus.google.com/107117483540235115863/posts/gcSStkKxXTw">recalled</a> on Google+ a particular Sunday in January 2008 when Apple’s boss asked him to call his home. The reason? The Google logo on the iPhone:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>So Vic, we have an urgent issue, one that I need addressed right away. I’ve already assigned someone from my team to help you, and I hope you can fix this tomorrow. I’ve been looking at the Google logo on the iPhone and I’m not happy with the icon. The second O in Google doesn’t have the right yellow gradient. It’s just wrong and I’m going to have Greg fix it tomorrow. Is that okay with you?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The following day, the world’s greatest product developer followed-up with an email message with the subject “Icon Ambulance”, directing Vic to work with Greg Christie to fix the icon. </p>
<blockquote><p><em>Since I was 11 years old and fell in love with an Apple II, I have dozens of stories to tell about Apple products. They have been a part of my life for decades. Even when I worked for 15 years for Bill Gates at Microsoft, I had a huge admiration for Steve and what Apple had produced. But in the end, when I think about leadership, passion and attention to detail, I think back to the call I received from Steve Jobs on a Sunday morning in January. It was a lesson I’ll never forget. CEOs should care about details. Even shades of yellow. On a Sunday.</em></p></blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's nearly impossible to deliver "revolutionary". Huge leaps in technology are rare. Huge leaps in anything are rare. To create great things you must take steps. Sometimes the largest steps you can. Steps that have some pain associated with them. But by taking steps, your audience, users, clients, etc. can follow along. They might be a bit uncomfortable, they might feel some pain. But they can deal with that. But if no one reaches, no progress is made.</p>

<p>Steve has pushed the boundaries for a long time. He wanted quiet machines that were easy to use. He wanted to eliminate the clutter computers required both mental and physical. He wanted them to be elegant and simple and purposeful. He wants them to disappear into the "doing" of it, without the device being the focus.</p>

<p>He didn't do this as an artist, working by himself in a studio advancing his personal craft. He edited and filtered the ideas of others, demanded precision and detail, and unforgiving excellence from generations of corporate citizens. He needed folks to follow along, trust his instincts, fix everything down the tiniest details. And then do it again, and again, and again.</p>

<p>To me it very much a tortoise and hare story. He kept going when others said enough. That's a hell of thing. Because it's easy to say "enough".</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've just started using <a href="http://glassboard.com/">Glassboard</a>. Glassboard is for sharing privately with groups on your iOS, Android or WP7 devices. But while I've barely sent a message as yet it fits so well where tools like Twitter were failing. And yes, that means that it only runs on mobile devices at least for now. Could easily work, but for me, having the ability to see activity on my boards from bots, or notify my desktop could be helpful. Maybe. I have to think about that some more. But it certainly seems that way for the use cases I have in mind for myself.</p>

<p>There are other tools that I've been using that do similar things (so far) like Groupme which has advantages (at least for now). For example, not everyone I work with or everyone in my family has a smart phone. But every one (at least as of recently) can receive and send text messages. But they also fail in various ways.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to see how Brent and crew move this forward.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/click.phdo?i=3b8b273da312f721ccb0e2f52fecd02d">10.7: Have a custom Dock per Space</a>: An awesome new feature in OSX Lion that is easily overlooked is the ability to customize the Dock in each Space.
<br><br>
By right clicking or Ctrl+clicking on a dock icon and then going to 'Options' you will notice the ability to assign that icon to 'All Desktops', 'This Desktop' or 'None'. None is set by default.
<br><br>
A simple yet useful feature that was requested so many times in Snow Leopard.
<br><br>
[<b>crarko adds:</b> This is legitimately cool if you like to use custom Spaces, and a good follow-up to <a href="http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110722124722185">this hint</a>.]<br style="clear:both;">

In Spaces (Now 'Desktops,' which I suppose is more accurate) desktops numbered 1-10 are defined by Control+(1-0) and desktops 11-16 by Control+Option+(1-6). These are useful to know if you regularly use lots of spaces, and are easy to remember. 
<br><br>
You can easily turn off ALL Mission Control shortcuts in System Preferences, but the Control Left-right keys are still quite useful, and don't conflict with many apps.
<br><br>
The trick is to have all the desktops active BEFORE you try to edit keyboard shortcuts if you want to edit just the ones for the desktops. 
<ul>
  <li>To turn off just the keys for each Space, first go into Mission Control.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://www.winterspeak.com/2011/08/unconventional-monetary-policy.html">Unconventional Monetary Policy</a>: "Unconventional monetary policy" means the Fed targets some level of nominal GDP and keeps buying things until that level is met. Usually, the Fed buys and sells short term Treasuries to influence the clearing price of reserves in the overnight interbank market. The clearing interest rate in the overnight interbank market is the "Federal Fund Rate" and this intervention is the mechanism it uses to manage the level of excess reserves in the system (as it can drain reserves by converting them to Treasuries). Scott argues that the Fed can buy other things, like road repair services, bridge building services, etc. etc. and therefore hit any NGDP target it chooses.  <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Hmmm.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://speirs.org/blog/2011/8/28/a-supercomputer-in-every-backpack.html">A Supercomputer in Every Backpack</a>: People visit my school all the time. They shake my hand as they leave and tell me how inspiring it all is and often they sign off with "truly, the iPad is the future of education". I bite my tongue every time because unlike Richard Stallman I'm not an anti-social jackass, but I want to correct them.

I want to tell them that the iPad is not the future of education, it's the present of education. If we consign the iPad to the realms of the future, then we are implicitly saying that it's not for right here, right now, today. We're saying that we can postpone the task of seriously engaging with the educational and social impact of ubiquity of Internet-connected computing.

I ask you to consider other industries that put off dealing with such challenges. How is that approach working out for record companies? For newspapers? For booksellers?

The hour is already late. We have allowed a 16-year gap to develop between society and schools in terms of our children's access to computers. Can we properly prepare Beth and her cohort for the year 2029 with the same level of access to computers that I had 35 years before?

How long can we let this gap continue to grow? Another five years? Another ten? In another 14 years, if GSMA are right, society as a whole will have 7 connected devices each - will we be delivering relevant education in that world if each pupil only has a third of a computer to themselves?

Cedars is not a school of the future. I think we're a decade late. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Everything that Fraser has been working cuts close to my heart as I concern myself Noah's education. What parts are his school getting right? What parts are they getting wrong? Where is it so bad that I need to shore it up, where can ignore it as it as irrelevant? Clearly his school has the computer and technology stuff wrong. But I don't think it matters because that is something that I can (fortunately) fix. Not everyone can, but I (we) can. The stuff I can't fix? What they feed him. The crappy behaviors he learns from the kids on the bus. Yeah, I know all survivable stuff, but considering the importance of these years… anyway, consider how your child's education doesn't match the needs of the marketplace. What are you going to do about it? Where do you think it's lacking?]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://sashadichter.wordpress.com/2011/08/31/the-screwdriver/">The screwdriver</a>: When we talk about ourselves, and our own experiences, there’s no amount of generosity that feels like too much.  When we talk about others, everything is supposed to be bounded and thought out and make sense.

Generosity is a way of walking through the world and spreading joy.  Nothing more, nothing less.

It’s up to you to decide how much you want of that in your life. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Righteo.]</cite> <br />

For those who asked if we sold out of financial desperation, the answer is a definitive "no." We sold out of a sense of aggression. If nothing else, 20 years of bike racing has honed my sense of timing for an all-in attack. The moment is perfect for us to fast-track our ultimate vision for Competitive Cyclist.</p> <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[My local guys need to embrace this more than they have…]</cite>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~3/2BAuW4RUf0M/2998-setting-up-a-new-machine-for-ruby-development">Setting up a new machine for Ruby development</a>: <p>It used to be a jarring experience to setup a new machine for development, but progress has paved the dirt road into a silky smooth autobahn. These are the tools we use today:</p>


<ol><li><a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>: Remember how painful it used to be to get imagemagick installed? Now it takes about a minute. “brew install imagemagick”. Same story for git and other Linux dependencies.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a>/<a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build">ruby-build</a>: We have some apps running on Ruby 1.8.7, some on 1.9.2, and some on 1.9.3. ruby-build makes it easy to compile all three, rbenv makes it easy to switch between them on a per-project basis. We run rbenv in production as well, so all you need to do to change the Ruby version there is alter .rbenv-version—development and production is always on the same page.</li>
<li><a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a>: Not everyone at 37signals loved Bundler at first, but now that it’s stable, they’ve been won over. I now curse whenever I have to use an old application that hasn’t been setup with Bundler. Manually tracing down dependencies?! How prehistoric!</li>
<li><code>rake setup</code>: All our apps has a rake setup task that’ll run bundler, create the databases, import seeds, and install any auxiliary software (little these days) or do any other setup. So when you git clone a new app, you know that “rake setup” will take care of you.</li>
<li><a href="http://pow.cx/">Pow</a>: No more messing with Apache or nginx for local development. All it takes for Pow to add another app is a symlink. All the apps are always configured and available at basecamp.dev, highrise.dev, etc without messing with the hosts file either.</li></ol>

	<p>Thanks to Max Howell for Homebrew, Sam Stephenson for rbenv/ruby-build and Pow, and Carl Lerche/Yehuda Katz for Bundler. Thanks to them, starting from scratch has never been easier.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Some new stuff to try out. RVM hasn't really lit me up...]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_S._Hart">Michael S. Hart, Founder of Project Gutenberg, Dies at Age 64</a>: <p>From his obituary at Project Gutenberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hart was best known for his 1971 invention of electronic books, or
eBooks. He founded Project Gutenberg, which is recognized as one
of the earliest and longest-lasting online literary projects. He
often told this story of how he had the idea for eBooks. He had
been granted access to significant computing power at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. On July 4 1971, after
being inspired by a free printed copy of the U.S. Declaration of
Independence, he decided to type the text into a computer, and to
transmit it to other users on the computer network. From this
beginning, the digitization and distribution of literature was to
be Hart’s life’s work, spanning over 40 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A true pioneer, who made the world a better place.</p>

<p>Good ol’ Yvon Chouinard. A couple of days ago, Patagonia announced a <a href="http://campaigns.ebay.com/patagonia/join/"><strong>partnership with Ebay</strong></a>, urging consumers to buy and sell their used Patagonia garments and refrain from purchasing the new stuff. The whole thing is part of the longstanding <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/common-threads/"><strong>Common Threads Initiative</strong></a>, and in order to be part of the buying and selling bonanza, you have to make a pledge to Reduce, Repair, Reuse, Recycle and Reimagine. No argument here.</p>
<p>Sorta makes any “We made this garment with the most eco-friendly this and that” greenwashing statements a little less powerful, eh? Because really, what’s more eco-friendly than telling people to buy used gear?</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Yvon &amp; Co. Really push the limits huh? Awesome.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Cycleexif/~3/331k87WDCbw/interview-fast-boy-cycles">Interview: Fast Boy Cycles</a>:  I danced professionally for a few years, and then taught for almost ten. For a lot of that time I had a company and was making work. I went to art school (university of the arts in Philadelphia). I thought I was going to study industrial design. I was pretty disenchanted when I realized that the industrial designers weren’t that involved in the engineering side of making stuff (or really the MAKING side of making stuff). Mostly just how it looked. How it felt. So there was a lot of CAD work, and some molding of models out of plastic. Someone dared me to take a dance class one night. I did. It seemed like much more fun than the visual arts core classes I was taking, so I switched majors the next day (“you want to switch majors!?” “Yes, if that’s possible.” “have you ever danced before!!?” “Yeah… I took a class last night.”). I stopped to catch my breath almost 15 years later and realized that I sort of hated dance. When I finally ran away screaming, building bikes seemed like a safe harbor. Can’t remember how I connected THOSE dots. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Go read the whole thing. Ezra Caldwell takes great photos, builds beautiful bikes, and continues to beat cancer. In a world where "awesome" is overused…]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.truerwords.net/6398">The New BostonGlobe.com</a>: <p>I'm beyond impressed with the <a href="http://bostonglobe.com/">new Boston Globe</a> web site. It's the best I've ever seen. Congrats to @beep and the rest of the designer/developer team. As +Craig Hockenberry said on Twitter, other newspapers are going to look at it and either realize they need to imitate it, or they'll keep dying.</p>
<p>
If you have a big monitor, resize your browser window from very narrow through to full screen. Go very slowly, and watch as the layout adapts to the new size, every step of the way. The images resize, the number of columns will change from 1 to 2 to 3, each column's width changes... it's brilliant.</p>
<p>
(What I've mentioned here is just the first-glance stuff. Look around, the attention to usability and detail is intense.)</p> <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Impressive work.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A moment form my personal Wayback Machine: <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/oldsite/581.html">On Pacifism</a>: "I hate war. I hate destruction. I cry my way through the reports of those who cannot yet release the hope that their loved ones will return despite what they have seen. You can feel the disturbance in the City. Not just in the quiet, or the change in rhythm, but in the disruption of lives. Those "lost" are present, infused with the anguish of those they left behind."</p>

<p>There's some more with emergency information and quotes and pictures lost in the transition from one bit of software to another. The release of anxiety I felt when all the first responder folks I know had checked in with their families. But I can still feel the changes from back then if I care to. </p>

<p>We avoided the coverage this weekend as the 10th anniversary passed. I didn't want to relive those moments. But I did the love the story of Camp America, which now closed it doors, its goal accomplished, and of the flag that has been mended and patched by folks all over… and then part of me wondered what I wrote…</p>

<p>Anyway…</p>

<p>I pray for peace.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre>"When I was a child, I thought
God was disappointed
whenever some distraction interrupted...
Now I know that God expects such interruptions,
for He knows our frailty.
It is completion that surprises Him."

--From the God Whispers of Han Qing-jao</pre>

<p>Noah loves playing with patterns. Colors, shapes, letters, lego pieces, alternation, similarity… the whole gamut.</p>

<p>But he also gets upset when for one reason or another he can't complete a pattern the way he'd like. Lack of resources, lack of concentration. What have you. He likes a nice tidy world from that perspective (although not from many others…)</p>

<p>There's much yet to teach.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I had fallen out of love with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> a long time ago, but last week’s sneaky move (read about it <a href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/17/linkedins-social-ad-misstep/">here</a>) pushed me over the edge. What a lost opportunity. LinkedIn was built on such a fantastic core idea. And then they tried to be twitter-and-facebook-and-everything-else at once. Bummer. </p>
<p>But don’t worry, here’s a new service that seems to be getting it right: <a href="http://www.zerply.com">Zerply</a> is a beautifully designed service that let’s you find like minded people by tags, skills, location and let’s you set up a public profile themed by world class designers.</p>
<p>You’re dreading entering all your information again? No worries, you can import all of your information directly from LinkedIn during the setup. Easy peasy. </p>
<p>I hope that <a href="http://www.behance.net/">Behance</a> will strike a deal with them and let us display our portfolios on <a href="http://www.zerply.com">Zerply</a> as well. </p>
<p>Hat tip to the team behind Zerply. They site is beautifully designed and well considered. Here’s <a href="http://www.zerply.com/profile/swissmiss/public">my public Zerply my profile</a>. </p> <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Seems like a good idea… but I haven't tried it yet...]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/you-have-every-right-photograph-cop">You Have Every Right to Photograph That Cop</a>: "Taking photographs and video of things that are plainly visible in public spaces is a constitutional right — and that includes the outside of federal buildings, as well as transportation facilities, and police and other government officials carrying out their duties.

However, there is a widespread, continuing pattern of law enforcement officers ordering people to stop taking photographs or video in public places, and harassing, detaining and arresting those who fail to comply. The ACLU, photographer's groups, and others have been complaining about such incidents for years — and consistently winning in court. Yet, a continuing stream of incidents of illegal harassment of photographers and videographers makes it clear that the problem is not going away."

		<title>I am a job creator who creates no jobs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/i-am-a-job-creator-who-creates-no-jobs/2011/09/20/gIQAhpgGjK_story.html">I am a job creator who creates no jobs</a>: I should add that I am in no danger of being caught in the net of President Obama’s proposed millionaires’ tax. I pay the accountants a few thousand dollars, and they make sure I am not paying more in taxes than I should be. (Note to the IRS: They do this in ways that are conservative, entirely above-board and so innocuous that they should not attract your interest in the slightest.)</p>

<p>While there is something absurd about being a one-man corporation, it’s a rational response to an irrational tax code. If lawmakers got serious about tax reform that removed loopholes, the money spent on accountants and actuaries (valuable though they are) could instead be used to grow the economy or to pay the federal debt. But that’s a matter for another day.</p>

<p>At the moment, the Ink-Stained Inc. case study, should the Harvard Business School wish to study it, is a reminder to be skeptical of the “job creator” argument in the tax debate. “It’s a good example of the murkiness of what we mean by small business and the connection to jobs,” William Gale, co-director of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution’s Tax Policy Center, told me. “There’s sort of this notion of small-business innovation and job creation that just doesn’t necessarily hold.”</p>

<p>That’s even more so with Obama’s “Buffett Rule,” under which millionaires would have to pay a higher tax rate than a typical middle-class worker. As a practical matter, most already do. Gale said the rule would raise the taxes on only a few thousand people, perhaps as few as 1,000.</p>

<p>In a nation of more than 300 million, that’s not going to make a dent in job creation. Even the data analysts at Ink-Stained Inc. could figure out that one — that is, if we had any data analysts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Folks keep asking why the old DVD service will gain a new company name… Qwickster</p>

<p>My take? They're just "riding down" the DVD through the mail thing until infrastructure and services support streaming for us all… and by then Netflix will be a "cable company". Therefore, they don't want that "ebbing" business associated with the Netflix brand. Hmmm.</p>

<p>Streaming in some forms works very nicely. One version provided by Cablevision (much as I can't stand them) which I've only tried on the smallest of screens (my phone), has an app that while you're on your home network will allow you watch whatever is "on the air" so to speak. It works nicely.</p>

<p>To rely on that same net connection (amazing that it can be so poor at some things and yet manage the above) for a more generalized stream of HD movies etc. is to plan long in advance, be uncertain of your plans, and hopeful that streaming means "local caching". If doesn't, it doesn't really work.</p>

<p>That said, I almost never watch a movie… so none of this really impacts me.</p>

<p>All in all, Netflix clearly made a mistake when they gave streaming away for free. There ain't no thing… etc.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Noah reminds me, most days, to live closely to who you are. And sometimes you try on new things and see how they work.</p>

<p>Some of this is a question of perspective. I once took a short hike, but it was my turn to carry the load… literally. I carried a large day pack and had food and water and extra clothing for all of us. Not too far in to the wilds of New Hampshire a couple comes hiking down the trail, and we meet over the tussle of who's coming up, who's going down, and stepping around the usually close trail.</p>

<p>What they saw was a guy on an adventure… backpack, walking stick, etc. Where'd you camp they asked? Where are you staying tonight? I granted their confusion… I've been that guy, I've done those things enough for authenticity to remain in evidence. But still, I was not that guy that day. But it was clearly exciting for them to meet someone that was doing that… like they wanted to but hadn't got there yet.</p>

<p>We see who and what we want. We see problems if that's what we want. We see Truth if that's what we need. The power of seeing is in allowing room for others to be seen as they wish, rather than what we wish for them. By seeing, actually seeing, people as they are, we can empower them to live as they choose… or as they wish to, even they're not there yet.</p>

<p>Changing settings give people that freedom. Move to a new place where no one knows you and it is easy to weave a new story if you choose. The trick, as it were, it to get people to see you as you wish to be seen without that fresh start. Evolving a story is more complicated and requires permission and time.</p>

<p>But don't let any of this stop you from living how you choose, with a vision for yourself as you wish it to be. Just realize that it may take a long time for others to see it as well. It doesn't make it less true. People who you see as they wish to be seen could well see you as you wish to be seen. And may help you get where you want to go.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/fortuneapple20/~3/uT2herPWSOA/">Google gave 'the ultimatum only a monopolist can give'</a>: For me, the testimony of Yelp's Stoppelman and Nextag CEO Jeff Katz was the most compelling, because it came from Web-based entrepreneurs who know all too well how the game is played.

Here's the crux of the story Stoppelman told the senators: 

"The experience in my industry is telling. Google forces review websites to provide their content for free to benefit Google's own competing product, not consumers. Google then gives its own product preferential treatment in Google search results.

"Google first began taking our content without permission a year ago. Despite public and private protests, Google gave the ultimatum that only a monopolist can give: In order to appear in Web search, you must allow us to use your content to compete against you. As everyone in this room knows, not being in Google is equivalent to not existing on the Internet. We had no choice."

Google softened its stance, according to Stoppelman, only after the FTC announced an antitrust investigation, the states' attorneys general took notice, and the Senate antitrust committee proposed this hearing.

The text of Stoppelman's written testimony is available here.

<a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/09/21/facetime-calls-are-encrypted-hipaa-compliant/">FaceTime calls are encrypted, HIPAA compliant</a>: <p style="text-align:center;">
	<img alt="" src="http://www.blogcdn.com//media/2011/03/ipad2camerasfacetime.jpg" style="width:456px;height:207px;"></p>
<p>
	This isn't <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/10/21/facetime-for-mac-security-hole-easily-remedied/">the issue</a> from last fall, but <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/facetime-calls-are-encrypted-and-hipaa-compliant-when-using-proper-encryption/11166">Apple addressed questions regarding FaceTime security to ZDNet</a>. An Apple representative assured the site that the FaceTime conversation stream is encrypted from end to end, and each FaceTime session has unique session keys for each user.</p>
<p>
	What this does is make FaceTime HIPAA compliant as long as the wireless network being used utilizes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access">WPA2 Enterprise</a> security with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">128-bit AES encryption</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act">HIPAA</a> (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is the U.S. standard for electronic health care transactions designed to keep these records secure and protect patient privacy. With the protocols being followed, those in the healthcare industry can apply for grants for Apple gear since HIPAA compliance is required.</p>

  <p>Then there’s Meg Whitman, who expected at this point to have
resigned from the HP board to spend all her time running
California as governor. But that didn’t happen, so now what is
she to do? You can only get so many pedicures. She’ll eventually
get around to hip-checking Apotheker and taking his job.</p>

<p>Can’t get more accurate with a prediction than that.</p>

<blockquote>"Those skeptics are in every walk of life. You can certainly combat it with the experimenter role. Show people it's possible, don't just tell them. It's always been the seemingly improbable, boundary-pushing ideas that have created this world around us and none of that would have been possible if they'd listened to all the people who said it never would have worked. We'd still be living in caves if we relied on the skeptics."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Netflix, Twitter, and Google make unasked-for, unanticipated, and unstoppable change in their products, which also happen to be our work and play spaces.</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>But the freedom of usage that defined personal computing does not extend to the world of parental computing. This isn't a bug in the way that cloud services work. It is a feature. What we lose in freedom we gain in convenience. Maybe the tradeoff is worth it. Or maybe it's something that just happened to us, which we'll regret when we realize the privacy, security, and autonomy we've given up to sync our documents and correspondence across computers.</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.theangrydrunk.com/2011/09/20/its-the-content-providers-silly/">It’s the Content Providers</a>: <p>The Angry Drunk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the Netflix changes are certainly annoying, and the
messaging was less than stellar, we need to make sure to remember
where the blame ultimately lies  —  with the content
providers. Until they decide to get with the program content
distributors like Netflix and Apple will always be at their mercy
and customers will continue to suffer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><p>The answers to these ques­tions, and I believe the dri­ving force behind the Netflix changes all involve one group: the con­tent providers. The tech press some­times seems to think that dis­trib­u­tors like Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Redbox, Blockbuster, etc. just pull this con­tent mag­i­cally out of their asses. They ignore the fact that there are pow­er­ful movie stu­dios and record labels that are obsessed with main­tain­ing con­trol over their prod­uct dis­tri­b­u­tion and are scared shit­less over dig­i­tal dis­tri­b­u­tion. How soon we for­get that a major Netflix con­tent provider, Starz, recently told Netflix to piss up a rope and took their ball home.</p></blockquote>

<a href="http://mobileopportunity.blogspot.com/2011/09/amazon-vs-apple-no-its-amazon-and-apple.html">Google's reaction to Kindle Fire</a>:

<blockquote>
  <p>You're not the licensee Droid is looking for.  Google's reaction to Kindle Fire speaks volumes about its goals for Android.  Kindle Fire is based on Android, and will run Android applications.  Android has been struggling in the tablet space, so you'd expect that Google would be delighted to have Amazon on the Android bandwagon.  But you'd be wrong.  Let's look at the press release Google issued today to welcome Amazon to the Android family.  Wait a minute, there is no press release.  Okay, so let's look on the Google blog.  Nothing at all.  Maybe a tweet from Andy Rubin?  Dead silence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Slouching toward Bethlehem.  One revolution I'm sure is coming is the remaking of the print publishing industry.  As I've said before (link), once about 20% of the reading public has electronic devices, an established author can make more money bypassing print and selling direct through e-readers.  I think the new Kindle line, and especially the entry-level Kindles at $99 and below, will finally push us past the 20% threshold.  It will take a couple of years to play out, but this will force the long-awaited restructuring, or destruction, of the traditional book publishing industry.</p></blockquote>

<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/28/canLarryRebootGoogle.html">Can Larry reboot Google?</a>: Bill Gates got to this point with Microsoft, tried to re-whip the intelligence of his early days, failed, and went on to be a philanthropist.

Steve Jobs was fired before Apple could get to this point. He spent years in the wilderness, came back and somehow got Apple to turn the corner. Probably because he had no reason not to fire the losers who accumulate in BigCo's. There was a huge purge at Apple in 1997 and 1998.

Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg are there now. Neither of them has made it over the hump. Will they be Steve or will they be Bill? Or something else. <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Something else… if anything.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://chipotle.tumblr.com/post/11027786087">A new iPhone prediction</a>: <p>Out of all the pundits who will explain over the next 24 hours why the iPhone 4S is a huge disappointment, less than 1 in 20 will even <em>attempt</em> a coherent defense of that position.</p>

<p>“All right, the camera meets or exceeds anything else on the market in a phone, as does the CPU. Yes, iMessage beats BBM, and has nothing directly comparable on any other platform. Sure, it’s actually a ‘world’ phone now, and it has HSDPA data speeds. Yeah, iOS 5 addresses complaints with notifications and a lot more. Okay, iCloud isn’t quite like any other syncing solution and it could be a <em>really</em> big deal, and the cloud-based iTunes is—no matter what you may think of iTunes—a killer media manager. And sure, we’ll have to see how Siri works in practice, but up until now voice control has meant sitting in your car repeating ‘Dial Martha’ over and over in slow, mounting frustration—if Siri does what it’s supposed to, it’s operating on a level we haven’t seen before outside of sci-fi movies.</p>

<p>“So all in all, we have to conclude this was <em>quite</em> a disappointment.”</p> <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Heh. I agree. Siri could be, ahem, well siriously amazing. I've lived a number of "voice activation" features in my car and phones, and I've found them utterly useless. I haven't participated in the betas for iOS5 for lack of time, but I'm excited to give this a go. It could be great. Even insanely so.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/10/04/occupySiliconValley.html">Occupy Silicon Valley?</a>: Instead of bundling parcels of mortgages and turning them into derivatives, they bundle up parcels of people and turn them into masses of users, who generate content. Then they sell access to those users for a price, to other businesses. The problem is that as growth levels off, and it's sure to do that (how many more groups of 800 million can Facebook find, and where will they have to go to find them, and who will they have to sell out to to get there) -- they're going to have to take more from those users. Zuck calls it "sharing." The rest of us call it "privacy." <cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I find it interesting that the vast majority of friends and family have barely any network/social presence at all.]</cite> <br />

<p><a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1949">Unprecedented Arctic ozone hole in 2011; a Florida tropical storm next week?</a>: An unprecedented ozone hole opened in the Arctic during 2011, researchers reported this week in the journal Nature. Holes in the Antarctic ozone layer have opened up each spring since the early 1980s, but the Arctic had only shown modest springtime ozone losses in the 5% - 30% range over the past twenty years. But this year, massive ozone destruction of 80% occurred at altitudes of 18 - 20 kilometers in the Arctic during spring, resulting in Earth's first known case of twin ozone holes, one over each pole. During late March and portions of April, the Arctic ozone hole was positioned over heavily populated areas of Western Europe, allowing large levels of damaging ultraviolet rays to reach the surface. UV-B radiation causes skin damage that can lead to cancer, and has been observed to reduce crop yields in two-thirds of 300 important plant varieties studied (WMO, 2002.) The total loss of ozone in a column from the surface to the top of the atmosphere reached 40% during the peak of this year's Arctic ozone hole. Since each 1% drop in ozone levels results in about 1% more UV-B reaching Earth's surface (WMO, 2002), UV-B levels reaching the surface likely increased by 40% at the height of this year's hole. We know that an 11% increase in UV-B light can cause a 24% decrease in winter wheat yield (Zheng et al., 2003), so this year's Arctic ozone hole may have caused noticeable reductions in Europe's winter wheat crop.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[What a mess...]</cite> <br />

<p><a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2011/10/05/the-journey-was-the-reward/">The journey was the reward</a>:
<p>I was in the midst of late edits on <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527/">The Intention Economy</a></em> this afternoon, wondering if I should refer to Steve Jobs in the past tense. I didn’t want to, but I knew he’d be gone by the time the book comes out next April, if he wasn’t gone already. So I decided to make the changes, and stopped cold before the first one. I just couldn’t go there.</p>
<p>Then the bad news came a few minutes ago, through an AP notification on my iPhone. Tonight we all have to go there.</p>

<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[(I found out the same way…)]</cite>

<p>Turns out Steve’s muse was the best in the history of business. No one-hit wonders. We’re talking about world-changing stuff. Again and again and again.</p>
<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Sigh. Go read the rest of Doc's piece and his email from so long ago. Amazing.]</cite> <br />

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/10/universe_dented_grass_underfoot">★ Universe Dented, Grass Underfoot</a>: <p>One of Jobs’s many gifts was that he knew what to give a shit about. He knew how to focus and prioritize his time and attention.</p>
<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[And is one of the most critical skills any of us can develop. Not just the ability to prioritize, or the often mistaken-as-a-skill being able to blow stuff off. But the true, "focusing on the important things". Thoughtfully deciding that something is worth the limited amount of time and attention and focus we have, and choosing that this, right now, is the thing. Because not doing that is a waste of what limited time we have. Even the longest life is short measured in time. Lisa wondered how long after Steve's passing I would say something to her about the fact that he was only 9 years older than I am now. I did tonight. If today was my last day was it well spent? And not in the overly dramatic way that sounds at first read. I often must be careful with my capability to be maniacally intense, and I work on the balance needed to focus that kind of energy. I've often been asked "be more like this person or that person". I don't always fit comfortably into other people's worlds. In my personal life that's not a problem, but it is something that affects my work life. It's time to ensure that I don't live in that situation for any length of time any more. It's draining and uncomfortable, and it wastes what precious time I have. Today I got a chance to have some heartfelt conversations, crack a bottle of wine with some friends, and care for Noah. Now, I'm going to snuggle with my wife, and put this day in the "attaboy" column. With Yom Kippur arriving tomorrow eve, may everyone be signed and sealed for a happy, healthy, and prosperous new year. May anyone mourning the passing of loved one this past year find comfort and grace and joy in the new one.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/10/06/theMessageOfOccupy.html">The message of Occupy</a>: <p><a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/10/04/occupySiliconValley.html"><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2011/10/06/manInBlack.gif" width="135" height="420" border="0" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="5" alt="A picture named manInBlack.gif"></a>It's really simple. The United States has been run for the benefit of a very small group of people. That was never the idea of this country. This must change. </p>
				<p><i>Occupy Wall Street</i> is not part of any party. It's not left or right, although many of the people that are part of it look left. But if you look at the groups that are forming around the country, you'll see that it looks more like America than it does any single political discipline. If it works, it should be equally comfortable for a Republican who yearns for real representative government in the United States as it is for a labor union member, student or retiree. It should be the thing that we all agree on. The principle that Lincoln spoke of in the <a href="http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm">Gettysburg Address</a>. A government of the people, by the people and for the people. Whether it perishes from the earth is the question. Imho.</p>
				<p>The 99 percent message is brilliant, but it's problematic. What if I were a member of the 1 percent (I might be). Would my participation be welcome? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.truerwords.net/6399">The Friends We Never Meet</a>: I've watched people — friends — die from cancer. It's horrible. And I saw in his face that he knew, just like they knew.

There's so much more I'd like to say. Comparisons with exceptional people I respect from history and how rarely and brightly their lights shine, so rarely that we can name many of them even hundreds or thousands of years later. Or the fleeting nature of life, and how important it is that we do our best with what time and resources we have.

But mostly, since I learned in a text message from Corinne that "Steve Jobs died", I've been thinking about friends we never meet. People we interact with every day but in a very one-sided way, and how they can be important to us without them ever knowing it.

And how it hurts to lose them, even if they were never really there.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Brilliantly said.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.frankchimero.com/post/11098803237">via Frank : For Steve</a>: We all have that same opportunity. Take a moment to consider your job. Boil it down to its essence: you make things for other people. The most important concept to learn from Jobs is embedded in how we feel after using one of his products. That very same thing is happening now in his wake. Look closely and you will see it: wonderful experiences have an afterglow to them. The delight we find in what we do is in some way lost in the moment, but captured in our memories.</p>

<a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/10/08/iphone-screen-size">Size</a>: <p>Marco Arment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Android phones have been one-upping each other with screen size a lot recently. It’s an interesting tactic that seems to be working, at least relative to other Android phones. When comparing phones side-by-side in a store, the larger screens really do look more appealing, and I bet a lot of people don’t consider the practical downsides.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple generally tries to make it instantly obvious which of its products are better — what the trade-offs are. 16/32/64 GB: pay more, get more storage. iPhone 4S vs. 4: faster, better camera, Siri.</p>

<p>Bigger-screen iPhone proponents are telling me via email that they don’t necessarily want Apple to replace the 3.5-inch models with a 4-point-something inch one — just want a bigger screen model added to the lineup. But then which is “better”? I think it’s likely that many customers’ intuition would tell them that bigger must be better, and they’d make a choice they’d come to regret. What appeals to you in-store, side-by-side, isn’t necessarily what will appeal to you in long-term actual use.</p>

<a title="Permanent link to ‘Size’" href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/10/10/marco-size"> ★ </a>
<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[All true. But the point is subtle one. Many people may not care. It's the same problem being complained about in other threads that the "4S" is not "5". That somehow all new internals wasn't exciting enough for the tech press. But here, tech guys are arguing over whether a 4 inch screen is better compromise than a 3.5 inch screen and whether an individual's hand (specifically the person looking at this issue) can reach the entire screen as get it larger and is that a problem or not. For some, a larger phone with a bigger screen will be a better solution. For others, and I count myself among them, it wouldn't be. At some point, a device stops being a "phone" a starts being something else. And with that you've now entered a very complex space of tradeoffs and design decisions. Size, weight, thinness, pocket sizes, cost, capability, battery life, experience all weigh in on what a device is… and worse yet, you have to live with the decision for a while before you'll know whether it works or not and why. That is always an expensive proposition for users. It's why reviewers who review a lot of "stuff" often seem more picayune than the rest of us… it's not that they're more opinionated and more demanding although many of them cultivate that belief. It's that they're forced to use many more designs. When you do that, you feel the failure in your hand. ("Man. That's annoying!"). Yes, in the store a larger screen will have a positive impact, but carrying it in your pocket, not necessarily being able to reach across its surface and other issues may not be noticeable at first. It may feel like a cool drink of water in hell, or it may be one of those things that annoys you many times a day.. Hard to say from here. But that sucks.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/typepad/sethsmainblog/~3/PGrWIwO4JwE/open-conversations-or-close-them.html">Open conversations (or close them)</a>:<p>A guy walks into a shop that sells ties. He's opened the conversation by walking in.</p>
<p>Salesman says, "can I help you?"</p>
<p>The conversation is now closed. The prospect can politely say, "no thanks, just looking."</p>
<p>Consider the alternative: "That's a [insert adjective here] tie you're wearing, sir. Where did you buy it?"</p>
<p>Conversation is now open. Attention has been paid, a rapport can be built. They can talk about ties. And good taste.</p>
<p>Or consider a patron at a fancy restaurant. He was served an old piece of fish, something hardly worth the place's reputation. On the way out, he says to the chef,</p>
<p>"It must be hard to get great fish on Mondays. I'm afraid the filet I was served had turned."</p>
<p>If the chef says, "I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your meal..." then the conversation is over. The patron has been rebuffed, the feedback considered merely whining and a matter of personal perspective.</p>
<p>What if the chef said instead, "what kind of fish was it?" What if the chef invited the patron back into the kitchen to take a look at the process and was asked for feedback?</p>
<p>Open conversations generate loyalty, sales and most of all, learning... for both sides.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Of course, these simple examples (as important and relevant though they may be in context) are important as a lesson. Many of us get used to closing conversation. What if we were more open even if not directly related to our job? And the flip side. I've had many open conversations about a wide range of topics without anyone in the room telling me something important like "I'd prefer you work this way…" or "Why don't you do more of this?". Watch out for that...]</cite> <br />

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It is nicely done. I'm glad you told me about it - thanks. My take on kerning is sorta the obverse, though. When learning about type and learning to set metal type, I was given to understand that inter-letter spacing is about the relationships between pairs of letters (the rules and conventions of Letterforms), rather than by divvying up the voids between letters and counters. (When we moved to phototype, those conventions were, largely, preserved successfully by the makers of the tools and the letter pairs that "missed" could be kerned mechanically or with blade-and-pen-magic).
Raise the bridge, lower the water . . . your choice.
Still, I find *some* of the type coming out of the foundries today is very beautifully executed.]]></wp:comment_content>

<p><a href="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/10/police_photo_interference">NYPD Interfering with Photography</a>: <p>It appears that the NYPD—or at least some of their officers—are using strobing flashlights to purposefully interfere with cameras recording them during Occupy Wall Street protests. Here are two examples that <a href="https://twitter.com/duncan/status/125461838526824448">Lucy Kafanov tweeted earlier this evening</a>:</p>

<div style="margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px;">

<img src="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/10/police_photo_2_275w.jpg" width="275" height="206">
</div>


<p>This is really disappointing. I’d go so far as to say it’s reprehensible. It joins the list of bad things we’ve seen the police do in New York—such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpOMlDVaXzc">beating up protesters</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpOMlDVaXzc">beating them up some more</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMsr3tuWt9E">running them over</a>. It doesn’t really matter if you are aligned with the Occupy Wall Street protesters or not, you need to be aware of how our public servants are acting and what that says about our nominally free and open society.</p>

<a href="http://www.wilfridwood.com/">Wilfrid Wood</a>'s handlebar chandelier was one of many pieces made from everyday stuff in an exhibit at <a href="http://www.kkoutlet.com/art/2011/object-abuse">KK Outlet titled Object Abuse</a>. As pretty much the sweetest project there, this one probably sold, for the benefit of some local London school. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36763955@N07/sets/72157627598176036/?photo_deleted=6115433091">KK Outlet's Object Abuse flickr photoset</a>

<blockquote>Of course, technology pundits don’t pay attention to these kinds of things. They see a competitor to Apple, and how they have made an improvement, and they now want Apple to do the same. Apple then doesn’t. Everyone cries, nay, weeps at the thought of it all. In fact, when gadgets reviewers (supposedly unbiased) review a new Apple gadget, they take points off if the screen isn’t larger. Who says a larger screen is better? Doesn’t matter. Android has it, and so Apple needs to do it to stay competitive.</blockquote>

				<p>Helping people get to vote is a very powerful way to flex political muscles in a totally legal way. And prove that there is no specific agenda for the #OWS movement. Help all kinds of voters get to the polls. If a member of the ruling class needs help, we'll help. Anyone means anyone.</p>

    </p><p><a href="http://www.ba-reps.com/artists/jamie-chung/5066#image_414433">Jamie Chung</a> photographs the history of Apple products for <a href="http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20111005/steve-s-touch/"><em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em></a>. The magazine’s latest issue pays tribute to the late Steve Jobs and his visionary legacy at Apple. Chung’s photographs chart the history of Apple products, from the very first computer Jobs created to the iPhone and the iPad. The slideshow includes commentary from Jobs, the company’s history, and product information.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>Chung captured the new and old Apple products in a computer archive in New York City. The shoot was a nostalgic for Chung as he’d once had one of the company’s older models. He says he is “glad to participate in the tribute to Jobs’s legacy.”</p>

<p><a href="http://chipotle.tumblr.com/post/11439543456">Samsung Lawyer Cannot Tell Samsung Tablet From Apple iPad</a>: John Paczkowski, AllThingsD:

Fielding questions from U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, Samsung attorney Kathleen Sullivan was asked if she could distinguish between Apple’s iPad and Samsung’s Galaxy Tab 10.1, which Koh held up for all the court to see. Her reply, as first reported by Reuters: “Not at this distance, your honor.”

The distance in question was ten feet.

I bring this up not (solely) for mocking purposes, but because it underlines something that many people I’ve heard from about this case don’t seem to get. Apple is not, to the best of my knowledge, claiming that they’ve patented fundamental and obvious things about iPad-like devices, they’re claiming that Samsung deliberately copied the iPad. There are a lot of tablet makers that Apple is not suing, and Samsung was not chosen as an arbitrary example.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[every market has this. Designers do there thing and if it transits at all it gets knocked off. Talk to anyone in the jewelry or "shmata" business. That doesn't make it right, good, or anything, but only the largest companies can actually afford to do anything about it.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Asymco/~3/wtdepIe82Ms/">Clayton Christensen and Siri</a>: But it takes time. Like any truly useful breakthrough, it takes a long time to mature. And also like any disruption, the potential of Siri is rooted in four principles:
<ul>
<li>Humble early goals which it accomplishes well</li>
<li>A large population of enthusiastic adopters who give it sustenance</li>
<li>Plenty of headroom in improvement giving it areas to grow into with positive feedback</li>
<li>A patient sponsor who makes a stable living</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s no magic to it. In fact it’s banal. These are only the principles that every parent uses to raise a child.</p>

<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Swissmiss/~3/DSG6H_933Vs/52x52-org.html">52×52.org</a>:
<p>The lovely <a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/jessicahische.com">Jessica Hische</a> just revealed her latest do-good-side-project called <a href="http://52x52.org/">52×52.org</a> here at <a href="http://brooklynbeta.org/">BrooklynBeta</a>.</p>
<p>The idea: <a href="http://52x52.org/">52×52.org</a> will help you give to charity, every week, for one year. Her site will act as a messenger, not a middle-man, asking you to donate $52 directly to the featured charity. If $52 is too much, donate $25, $15 or $10! Give whatever you can, each and every week for one year, and together we will make a giant difference. Here’s the site: <a href="http://52x52.org/">52×52.org</a>. </p>
<p><em>If you want to help Jessica to make it easier to donate/give and help her build out the site, please get in touch with her!</em></p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Nice idea.]</cite> <br />

<p><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/10/21/1028500/-A-Voice-From-the-1">Daily Kos: A Voice From the 1%</a>: Thus you can imagine my amazement this summer when I watched the Republicans in Congress push the United States to the brink of default - and the world to the brink of ruin - over whether to repeal a portion of the Bush tax cuts and raise my taxes by 3.5%.  I know a lot of people with high incomes and even the conservatives among them were confused by that sequence of events.  Here is a secret about rich people:  we wouldn't have noticed a 3.5% tax increase.  That is not only because there isn't a material difference between having $1 million and $965,000, which is obvious, but also because most of us don't actually know how much money we are going to make in a given year.  Most income at that level is the result of profits rather than salary, whether it comes in the form of bonuses, stock options, partnership distributions, dividends or capital gains.  Profits are unpredictable and they tend to vary wildly.  At my own firm, the general rule of thumb is that if we are within 5% of our budget for the year, everyone is happy and no one complains.  A variation of 3.5% is merely a random blip.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[So right on it hurts.]</cite> <br /></a>

The terminal seems to hang for 30 seconds or more after displaying “Fetching source index for http://rubygems.org/.” Well I have some good news for you: the smart people behind Bundler and RubyGems.org have come up with a solution, and the new version of Bundler about to be released is a lot faster! Today I’m going to take a look at exactly why Bundler 1.1 is so much faster – at what exactly the RubyGems/Bundler teams did to speed it up.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Sweet.]</cite> <br /></a>

<p><a href="http://rs.io/2011/10/19/i-hate-my-smartphone.html">I Hate My Smartphone</a>: The rest of the ways that I interact with my smartphone, they’re all social and, as an introvert, it just doesn’t hold a whole lot of appeal for me. My text messaging skill and finesse, especially when compared to my typing ability, it’s pathetic. I hate trying to input text on the device, especially complex passwords: what a pain!</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[So let me see if I understand… a "geek" who implies a severely limited social life (I'll grant the choice) can't understand what all the fuss is for people who live on their phones. Hmmm. Wonder of wonders. (note the sarcasm here folks). I, of course, use my phone for silly things like having conversations… with a touch of email checking, a bit of social image sharing, and the odd bit of texting. I don't know how smart my phone has to be, but it sure is easier to do those things with it than the "dumb" phones I've owned.]</cite>

<p>Leaders, on the other hand, know where they'd like to go, but understand that they can't get there without their tribe, without giving those they lead the tools to make something happen.</p>
<p>Managers want authority. Leaders take responsibility.</p>
<p>We need both. But we have to be careful not to confuse them. And it helps to remember that leaders are scarce and thus more valuable.</p>

<p><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/typographica/~3/_bKpRgrL1o0/">Roboto is a Four-headed Frankenfont</a>: I’m all for the strategy of developing a unique identity typeface, and I commend Google for employing type designers in house, but this is an unwieldy mishmash. Roboto indeed has a mixed heritage, but that mix doesn’t have anything to do with the gibberish from the press release. Its parents are a Grotesk sans (like a slightly condensed Helvetica) and a Humanist sans (like Frutiger or Myriad). There’s nothing wrong with combining elements of these two styles to create something new. The crime is in the way they were combined: grabbing letters — almost wholesale — from the Grotesk model, along with a Univers-inspired ‘a’ and ‘G’, welding them to letters from the Humanist model, and then bolting on three straight-sided caps à la DIN.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Nice rant.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/10/steve_jobs_biography_the_new_book_doesn_t_explain_what_made_the_.2.html">Steve Jobs biography: The new book doesn’t explain what made the Apple CEO tick. - Slate Magazine</a>: <blockquote>He was also against adding apps to the iPhone.
</blockquote>

<p>Some behavior that describes Steve my family and friends would certainly say sounds like me at times (to my regret). And with (ahem) brilliant insight points out that Steve was wrong about certain things (duh). But I really understand that he was against adding apps to the iPhone.</p>

<p>Sure, there's lots of reasons why allowing apps was a good thing (in retrospect). I've certainly benefited from it in the sense that there are apps on my phone that Apple would never have created and that <a href="http://www.petersontuners.com/index.cfm?category=150">I love for their special use</a>. But for the most part the core apps Phone, Contact, Safari, Camera, Music, etc. are the ones that get the most use. While my phone is more useful with folks creating great native apps, it would not have been significantly less useful as a phone the other way.</p>

<p>There would have been negative side effects—it's a less interesting device if there isn't a near constant stream of of "content" in the form of apps. The iPad would not have been nearly as successful, even if the plan was to allow others to write apps for it, because the iPhone app market bootstrapped developer knowledge. </p>

<p>My wife's recent use of iPhone is teaching me how much "regular" people don't know about iPhones, iOS, and apps. My parents use of an iPad us kids bought for them teaches me similar lessons. If you ain't from the world of tech, you ain't from the world of tech. Even so, everyone muddles through, each in our own way. And hopefully without extensive use of terms like "bozo".</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/2011/10/06/steve-jobs/single-page/">Steve Jobs « The New Adventures of Stephen Fry</a>: It was a large and popular conference and Tim was pretty much at the end of the line of black NeXt boxes. Each developer showed Steve Jobs their new word-processor, graphic programme and utility and he slowly walked along the line, like the judge at a flower show nodding his approval or frowning his distaste. Just before he reached Tim and the world wide web at the end of the row, an aide nudged Jobs and told him that they should go or he’d be in danger of missing his flight back to America. So Steve turned away and never saw the programme that Tim Berners-Lee had written which would change the world as completely as Gutenberg had in 1450. It was a meeting of the two most influential men of their time that never took place. Chatting to the newly knighted Sir Tim a few years ago he told me that he had still never actually met Steve Jobs.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Incredible.]</cite>

<p><a href="http://chipotle.tumblr.com/post/11954809651">Two less cables</a>: Services like Hulu Plus and Netflix streaming have a huge problem getting content, and I continue to think that this is in no small part because they vastly underprice their services—which they do because consumers continue to decide how much they’re willing to pay for content based not on the content itself but on the delivery mechanism. If you watch a dozen shows and pay $120 a month for HD cable, you’re paying around $2.50 per episode. An iTunes season pass for a 24-episode show in HD is probably going to be about $45, or $1.88 an episode. Yet consumer behavior suggests we think iTunes is the service that’s priced unreasonably.*

I wrote a few months ago that I doubted you could do a streaming service that was really capable of supplanting cable or satellite unless it was at least $30 a month, and that’s probably including ads. I don’t think Netflix or Hulu could ask that kind of price and have a snowball’s chance in hell of succeeding. I doubt even Amazon could.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Lisa and I were discussing the math of cable just last night. Generally it doesn't provide the value you think it does. It's worth looking at what you use cable for… you might be able to drop it.]</cite> <br />

Based on what I know about journalism classes, and what Clay does (there's only one quote from Jay in the 10-minute video) he did what guest lecturers do, give their opinions on the topics of the day. This kind of stuff goes on in J-schools everywhere, every day, with people of all political persuasions.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[The first problem I have with this is with the first few seconds of video where the word "caught" is used. Dave in his piece used the word "stings" which might be closer. But certainly the word caught implies that either one of the subjects of the piece were doing something wrong. That's the kinda of crappy journalism we can expect from the next generation, who are busy trying to make a name for themselves pointing out the supposed flaws of the previous generation. It's all a terrible loop.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/10/27/anOrganizedRssAdvocacy.html">User-led RSS advocacy</a>: <p><img src="http://scripting.com/images/2011/10/27/loveRss.jpg" width="150" height="150" border="0" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="5" alt="A picture named loveRss.jpg">If you're a regular reader of this blog, take a few moments and read this <a href="http://feliciaday.com/blog/rss-rant">manifesto by actress Felicia Day</a> about the importance of supporting RSS. She says that some sources are turning off their feeds. I was not aware of this. I subscribe to new feeds all the time, and rarely do I find a source that updates regularly that doesn't have one. I think I'd notice.</p>
				<p>But what's reallly cool about this is that passionate and intelligent advocacy is coming from users. For me, that's new. And very welcome. I've felt like the only person who's willing to stick his neck out of the idea that we could have news flows that were not controlled by the tech industry. I was told that users would never understand why this is important. Well, looks like the people who said that were wrong. </p>
				<p>This happens regularly in the tech industry, as I've written about so often. In the early days of a technology, in this case news feeds, users need training wheels on their tools. But a few years later, they understand how it works, and they can see how they're being controlled. Shortly after that they break free of the bonds and a new layer of tech comes online.</p>
				<p>If you're a developer, it seems now is a good time to take a fresh look at building networks of news flow that doesn't run exclusively through Google, Twitter or Facebook. There is an architecture possible here, built on formats and protocols we all know well. XML, JSON, HTTP, DNS. All of it lightweight and easily cloned for lots of choice for users. </p>
				<p>But at least read <a href="http://feliciaday.com/blog/rss-rant">Ms Day's screed</a>. <img src="http://scripting.com/gifs/QBullets/qbullets/sidesmiley.gif" width="11" height="11" border="0" alt=":-)"></p>

		<title>Why I stand up for Stallman</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<p><a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/10/31/whyIStandUpForStallman.html">Why I stand up for Stallman</a>: A few years ago I met Richard Stallman, in Berkeley. It was arranged by my friend Sylvia Paull, who was his publicist (she might still be, I'm not sure). It was amazing, because one of his associates there (whose name I don't remember) was teasing me just like people in workgroups on the net were. I looked at him, and asked him if he seriously was going to do this, in front of Stallman. Yeah, he kept at it. That's how pervasive this culture of disrespect is. To Stallman's credit, he not only stopped it, but dug in. He wanted to understand what was at the root of this. I told him I had GPL'd my life's work. And this is the kind of treatment I was getting fairly widely. It wasn't a long conversation, but I could see in his eyes the empathy that Sam had been looking for so many years ago. People think Stallman is oblivious, but my feeling is he's a lot more aware than most people.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Anil Dash in the comments on the above story: "using that power to cow conference organizers and academics into submission to an arbitrary set of whims, the same as a rock star refusing to eat certain colors of M&amp;Ms. Just make good music, and ignore the unwelcome M&amp;Ms in the bowl. And be thankful someone wants to hear what you're singing."

Here's where I step in… most people get that story wrong and <a href="http://www.anildash.com/">Anil</a> does here. And I think it helps make a point, I'm simply trying to be pedantic about a often mistold story.

The "no red M&amp;Ms" (or whatever color) wasn't about arbitrary control and power but about trust. Setting a venue for a show requires a lot of technical work. There's an awful lot of voltage flying around those lights and plenty more in the audio systems. Cross connect something by mistake, lift a ground in the wrong spot, etc. and you greatly increase the chance that someone will get electrocuted and seriously harmed (if not killed).

The remove one color of M&amp;M while it seems arbitrary was a test. For something that the venue or promoter might feel is bullying or a power trip, if they attended to the detail of it, chances are that they're attending to the details that really matter as well. It's a litmus test for attention to detail.

While I had no problem pointing to a story about Stallman's inconsistency's, that's not a reason to jump on him. It doesn't smack of power trip to me. It simply seems like the a "possibles bag" of collected things that have gone wrong in the past, and an attempt to improve things in the future. Anyone who has done even some of what he does knows that expectations aren't ever clear enough. You arrive to give a talk and suddenly "could you just" do this event or something. And a million other assumptions that may or may not be true. That document rings true to me, although some of it might seem odd. So what.

So while Anil has a point in the "you must call it" section, you might want to consider that most of this has probably happened and is there to prevent it from happening again, if at all possible, and is no more a power trip than saying "These things have gone wrong in the past".]</cite> <br />

Feel free to add apps you think should qualify. Please don't just add your favourite app - do explain why you think the app qualifies as "ambitious". I reserve the right to prune the list as I see fit. Note, too, that I'm not just asking about "education" apps - I'm looking across the entire platform.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Nice. A great source for inspiration as well.

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/10/apps_are_the_new_channels">★ Apps Are the New Channels</a>: Why not the same thing for TV channels? We’re seeing the beginnings of this, with iPhone and iPad apps like HBO Go, Watch ESPN, and the aforementioned Bloomberg TV+. Letting each TV network do their own app allows them the flexibility that writing software provides. News networks can combine their written and video news into an integrated layout. Networks with contractual obligations to cable operators, like HBO and ESPN, can write code that requires users to log in to verify their status as an eligible subscriber.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Righteo, on some level. Whether or not that means an AppleTV is another question, but I agree with the direction.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm stating my problem with these apps to help me later. I need to craft a solution to this problem.</p>

<p>My laptop has relatively limited storage space. I want to keep my photos in a single library and my music in a single library. I want to keep the photos I love and music I'm currently loving in front of me as it were, and everything else out of the way. Multiple library's don't work… it's too hard to know where some music or a photo might be, and then I can't find anything.</p>

<p>So in short a I need a subset of photos and a subset of music that are part of a larger library. New additions (photos taken, or music recorded or purchased) need to be added to the one true library. The one true library does not need to be accessible at all times, it just needs to add new content when it is available.</p>

<p>If any of you have solved this problem, let me know :)</p>

<p>See also JDD's writing on the photo side of things as well. <a href="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/10/catalog_strategy_glimpse">Here</a> and <a href="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/10/case_against_multiple_catalogs">here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s impossible to significantly change the Mac Pro without
removing most of its need to exist.</p>

<p>But I think it’s clear, especially looking at Thunderbolt’s
development recently, that Apple is in the middle of a transition
away from needing the Mac Pro.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/02/mac-pros-marco">Jon Gruber</a>: "I concur."</p>

<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I want you to look at the bit below and put that together with the one above.]</cite>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://yieldthought.com/post/12239282034/swapped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad">Mark O’Connor Swapped His MacBook for an iPad and Linode</a>: <p>Fascinating, really. What enables him to work solely from an iPad is that he does all his work in Vim. So it’s the fact that he’s a code-writing Unix nerd that allows him to use the seemingly least-Unix-nerd-friendly computer ever as his sole work machine.</p></blockquote>

<div class="dRemark"><p>[And while this won't work for everything, it will become common for the computer near you (whatever the form factor) to seamlessly reach out to computing resources in the cloud when you wish. Big photo file needs editing? No problem—the original image is already in the cloud. Now run your image editor of choice on a whomping multi core rocket ship of a virtual machine with a a bunch of RAM. The file is saved back to the cloud (versions anyone?) and you release the resources until the next time you need them. Pay as you go? Sure. Why not. Need some resources all day every day? Pick a monthly plan. The computers near you are a gateway to the clouds.</p>

<p>There are fewer cases where we need all those compute cycles and storage local to us. And while there are some, and there will be always be some, for most of us, this will not be necessary any longer. Even the small computers available today like phones, pads, and small notebooks are very powerful machines. The stumbling block is the serious lack of infrastructure that ensures access to the cloud at all times. (It's getting better, but it ain't where it needs to be). Screen space is an issue, having just spent the better part of 5 days with real work to do and nothing but a phone to do it (nope, nothing rose to the level of running out and spending money on an iPad or a MiFi or the like, but another few days might have done it.) I was almost at the point where I was going to get a AppleTV to stream the screen of my phone to a large TV screen, and reattach the wireless keyboard, but I wanted to embrace this limitation knowing I'd go back to my normal routine as soon as connectivity was restored. It is amazing how well things worked overall (network speed was the number one issue). Generally it's not more computing power that I need, but a faster connection and larger screen (in that order).]</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="http://muddydogcoffee.wordpress.com/2011/04/01/why-the-keurig-k-cup-is-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-great-coffee/">Why the Keurig K-Cup is the beginning of the end for great coffee « Muddy Dog Roasting Co.</a>: Do you think that vision is crazy?  Let’s see.  How easy is it to buy a Walla Walla onion?  Never heard of it?  I’m not surprised.  I grew up with them, but they’re already a thing of the past.  Hundreds of vegetable varieties have already gone extinct, solely due to our desire to homogenize, to have crops that ship well, regardless of how they taste.  Only 5% of US apple varieties that existed just 200 years ago still exist today.   Ninety percent of vegetable varieties have gone extinct over the last 100 years in the UK. The crimson flowered broad bean, the Champion of England Pea, the Bath Cos Lettuce, and the Rowsham Park Hero Onion are just a few examples of vegetables that are lost forever.  Hundreds of heirloom vegetable varieties are on the brink of extinction.  And there are all kinds of other foods that are falling victim to this same phenomenon. Try to buy a really great charcuterie today – Boar’s Head is as close as you’ll get in most places.  A beautiful creme fraiche?   How about Yoplait?  Great cheeses?  We got your Kraft, RIGHT HERE.  Don’t believe me? Go check out Slow Food’s Ark of Taste.  Oh, what’s that, you would like to have a nice meal at a cute bistro?  Sorry, all that’s available now are chain stores like Panera, TGI Friday’s or Appleby’s.  But you can probably score some Jack Daniels chicken wings, or some other ill-advised mess.  I can sum it all up in one word: Monsanto.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[And while Jim of Muddy Dog Roasting Company explains from his perspective. I think this particular paragraph worries me more (I'm not a coffee drinker) in that it is part of a larger problem, which expressed perfectly above. And in case it isn't obvious the lost biodiversity is not just a loss of taste and experience. That's bad enough. But it has become entirely clear that eating different foods is healthy for you, and having variations of each food makes that easier (you eat a tomato, but it's a different tomato). The varying balances of the "ingredients" of a fruit or vegetable is a fundamental goodness. And the craft of growing and preparing food, where the results are not consistent at the "Monsanto" level and don't try to be is also a fundamental goodness. It's the same thing that is appealing about anything hand made. Sure, a dreadnaught style guitar has certain fundamental qualities. But each one is different. Hand build a bicycle and each one will have some personality even if you use the same measurements and tube set. That variation is good for us. And we need to be extremely careful that we don't lose it in a chase to the bottom in the name of efficiency and money.]</cite> <br />

So does the heater, and the engine. I've had batteries go bad while cars sat idle. Once I froze an engine block in a Wisconsin winter. But none of this was done to the car, deliberately, by companies in the car industry. Generally when my car breaks it's because I did something to it. (There are exceptions of course.)

The tech industry is update-happy. The rationale that somehow breakage is not only acceptable, but good -- is nonsense.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Nothing to add.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<p><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/betterelevation/~3/hObQBd5uAr8/">Turning Hardware Into Software</a>: We used to have the iPod app, which is now simply called “Music”. The previous app icon was a picture of an iPod, because that was the simplest way to explain what was going on with a single image. What was hardware is now software. With iOS 5, the gap has presumably been bridged, and the anachronistic iconography went away. On the other hand, I’d venture to guess that the Phone.app hardware handset icon isn’t going away for a while; the iPod was never an emergency device, and phones have been around a little longer than digital music players. I might not even know where to find a handset telephone in 2011, but the image as an icon is completely unambiguous.</p>

<p>Texture-rich, literal UI isn’t merely an affectation, and it isn’t there to comfort us, exactly; the purpose is to connect. For those of us who have been playing with technology since we were small children, a list of books—or any other kind of data—is second nature. For the generations of people who aren’t so technologically immersed, a wooden bookshelf adds context and warmth to what is otherwise perceived as a cold machine. Apple’s strength is connecting technology to human beings, and skeuomorphic design acts as a bridge between what we already understand and what must now be learned.</p>

<p>With the iPhone, we started communicating with technology via touch in a meaningful way for the first time. Apple added more touch gestures in Lion, and it’s probably a safe guess that the trend will continue. Semi-realism and texture invite touch. They invite interaction. Laugh at the leather and torn paper, but it’s a hell of a lot more inviting to touch than a cold hunk of metal and glass.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[This might be a permadiscussion. I don't mind per app branding, but the fiddly little pieces of parker hanging off of things that detest in real life, I can now detest without being to correct them in my digital life. harumph.]</cite> <br />

<p><a href="http://speedbloggen.com/2011/11/death/">Death. « Speedbloggen</a>: You may think it’s ok to die riding because its doing something you love. I call bullshit. Dying having overcooked a turn is a real shit way to die. We’ve all over cooked a turn in our lives… its not worth dying over and knowing how to save it is a basic skill. Yes it takes luck. Yes people die every day in any number of stupid ways, and people die on their bikes.

Work on your descending. Don't get suckered into anything above your level. Don't be afraid to melt a rim or pull off and think about the next set of turns. And really think about those big group rides. If the nature of the ride is that being off the front or the top ten folks is the only good place to be… tap out. It’s not worth it. I love Rapha products. I’ve come to love them. I love the branding and the adverts… but you know it isn’t real. Don’t show up for that ride thinking what you see on the website is real. Riding isn’t a sentimental act. It’s not romantic until you’re off the bike and the photos are processed and printed. Ride present, ride smart, think critically and make your own luck.

I saw a picture of the guy… he looks like he was a lovely fellow. His bars were too high, too many spacers. I’m willing to bet his stem was too short. How you sit on a bike matters. How your bike fits matters. How much weight you have and where your center of gravity is going down a hill matters. It’s life and death.

Thanks for indulging my rant. I’ll probably take this down later.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I feel this is worth repeating because it is too easy to get caught up in other things. My closest riding buddies know this. Others who I ride this more occasionally seem to get lost in their own fantasies. "Ride present, ride smart, think critically and make your own luck." ]</cite>

<p><a href="http://redkiteprayer.com/?p=6547">Risk vs. Danger : Red Kite Prayer</a>: I’ve made mistakes before and crashed. I’ll make mistakes again. The last thing in the world I’d want my error to do is cause people to avoid exciting roads. I can’t speak for Robert or his family, but the example of his life suggests that he would endorse getting on with the business of living by putting ourselves out there and we achieve that electric thrill no one will ever get from the TV.
The greatest service we can do our fellow riders is to remember them accurately, to ride with the care that will keep us out there, to remain clear on the difference between danger and risk, and to keep that sense of adventure alive.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[And another take.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2011/11/08/two_ipad_apps_i_just_got">Two iPad apps I just got</a>: <p>I just bought <a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/2011/04/introducing-prompt-ssh-for-ios/">Prompt by Panic</a>. I was inspired by that <a href="http://yieldthought.com/post/12239282034/swapped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad">guy who replaced his Macbook with an iPad</a>. It occurred to me that I could ssh into my dev machine from anywhere in the house and write code using vim. And I’m just weird enough to <em>want</em> to do that. (By “anywhere in the house” I really mean “three feet away on my other desk.”)</p>

<p>Prompt is cool. Simple, good.</p>

<cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I enjoyed Brett's honesty here (3 ft away, heh.), and I think while I know some folks who are screen based text editor lovers I cannot count myself among them, mostly because I can never remember the key commands that I need to remember (other than the most basic ones). Give me that GUI any day. That said, there are a lot of times when I need to SSH into a VM somewhere and get something done, and Prompt has been there for a while allowing to ease concerns regardless of where I am. (Now, to convince people to allow me to be out about even more… but anyway...)

There was one time when a session like that went from just a quick thing to "seriously?" in a very short while. I remembered that I had a wireless keyboard in my bag, got it paired up to the phone and got back to work. Infinitely better. So I get how you could do the same thing only even betterer on an iPad with its much larger screen. And I now take a keyboard with me more than I should.

But in the end I don't see a big difference between using an iPad and a keyboard and using a MacBook Air… at least for coding and operations work. I know they are actual and conceptual differences (everything from cost to OS etc.) I do love that folks are stretching the way they work to make things more pleasant. For those of us at the pointy end of the web,<a href="http://xkcd.com/303/"> running tests, or compiling code can often cause sword fights to break out</a>. So while the novelty is cool, and I love the idea of running tests etc. remotely as part of a workflow, and I think it bends people's minds around how you can work, where, and with a very small footprint, make sure you're not working hard at using cool tools if it doesn't make sense.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/2011/11/flash-focus.html">Adobe ends mobile Flash development</a>: 
<p>If web developers must make non-Flash implementations of everything, why bother making the Flash versions at all? This isn’t just the death of mobile Flash: it’s a confirmation from Adobe that <em>all</em> Flash is on its way out.</p>

<p>Adobe’s management is also being pragmatic about its priorities. Rather than fight a losing battle for a particular runtime, Adobe can focus on what it does best: making <em>tools</em> for creative professionals.</p>

<p>Whether those tools build Flash or HTML apps shouldn’t matter: they should build what creative professionals need to build, and these days, that’s native mobile apps and HTML5 web apps.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Too many small businesses do not pay attention to what's going on in technology with the oft stated "It's all too complicated.." etc. But it's not any more in many cases, and can make life simpler for both you and your customers.</p>

<p>Here's an <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/08/atandt-and-intuit-square-up-to-square-video/">announcement</a> from the late to the party Intuit and AT&amp;T. If you like those guys, maybe this is for you. But they're about two years behind <a href="https://squareup.com/cardcase/tabs">Square</a>, who have added CardCase to their lineup to make things even easier for your customers.</p>

<p>I had a conversation with a small vendor who complained about the ever increasing charges for various cards (points, no points, debit, etc. and the fact that he had to lease the machine forever. All that goes away with Square.</p>

<p>Now I'm the first to admit that the slick scenarios painted by the marketing vids are just that, but even if all it does is allow you to take credit cards it'll help. Recently the <a href="http://turnings.phrasewise.com/2011/10/31/october-snow/">October Snow</a> took out small businesses credit card machines near me. If you're a pizza shop, and there's thousands of locals who have had no power for days, shouldn't you be able to take a credit card? Also, the snow meant roads got salted. I go to the car wash since I'm too lazy to turn on the spigots I shut off for the winter, and once again, no credit cards. Really? Seriously? C'mon people. There's no excuse anymore. And I wouldn't mind a "Hello Mr. Berlinger, thanks for returning. Same wash as last time?"</p>]]></content:encoded>

I have been working with a number of small business owners that have had some issues with Square, they were turned on to it after dealing with poor processors and were looking for something simple. Unfortunately that simplicity meant they were paying over 2.5% on average which is much higher than what they needed to me. Again just wondering if you had additional information on how things have been going and what made you turn to Square.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I quote from your site: "Unfortunately due to the complexity of the rates, fees, and assessments that accompany every transaction, businesses find themselves dealing with an industry where margins can be padded, fees hidden, and worst often lengthy contracts and cancellation costs that actually penalize the small business that tries not to be taken advantage of."

The folks I've been turning onto Square have either not been able to take credit cards or are negatively impacted by the leasing of equipment, and various rates they are charged for different cards and types of credits (credit vs debit vs points/rewards cards).

The specific issues: In several cases it was too difficult to do credit card processing. One case was a baby sitter. She's just a kid essentially, but it was a lot easier for folks to her pay her once she was able to accept credit cards. Another case was a small boutique type of business where each transaction could $1000 or more but there aren't a high volume. Again the carrying cost for leasing the machine and the complexity is added to the business were not worth it to the owner. Sure, he tried it for a while, but was annoyed by it and so went all cash. The problem is that folks forget or don't know that he's a cash only business and then have to go running around to find an ATM machine, if they even have the necessary cash on hand (although his customers tend to...)

Another complained of not knowing where he was at with all his transactions because the sliding scale of different rates charged for each card made it the equivalent of impossible to calculate what was actually going to clear.

All these cases were solved by Square. And while I don't disagree about the rates, Square has shown that they're willing to reduce rates when they can. As there volume goes up they're able to do better deals and pass some of that on at least so far.

Additionally, they're at least thinking about how a merchant can use smartphones and tablets to make for a better customer experience. Their newish card case software is an example. It doesn't replace a genuine relationship with a customer, but it makes it easier to enable small transactions. It a good trend. Another example although a bit more "just for us" is Apple's new experience where you can pick up an item in their store, scan it with Apple Store software and it will charge your iTunes/App store account so that for any shelved item in an Apple store you don't even need to interact with an employee which for simple things in a busy store will also benefit both sides.

Sure the right mix of size and type of transaction and you might be able to do better through another service, and lot of folks have mentioned fee fighters lately... but for a lot of folks, especially those folks who don't ro can't handle the complexity and cost associated with merchant accounts etc. etc. Square is perfect. Let's hope for some serious competition.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Of iPhones and Thermostats, a legacy has begun</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://www.nest.com/">Nest</a> ships their first product. It's a thermostat that is essentially a smart phone tied to your heating/cooling systems, with a some sensors and the ability to learn. It learns when you turn the temps up and down, how often you walk by it when you're home, how quickly or slowly your home heats and cools and most likely some other things. They sold out of 4 months of production in 72 hours.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, I had to bring my phone in to get it swapped out. And while at this backwater little Apple store ay 9AM I again saw the line outside for people purchasing the iPhone 4S five weeks after its initial release. I've seen this by every store I've been in or walked past. Two in New York City, one in Westchester County, One in Rockland County and this one in NJ.</p>

<p><img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/img_1157.jpg" alt="4S queue outside of an Apple store" border="0" width="400" height="400" /></p>

<p>Nest was started by an Apple alum, and was a designer there for 9 years. The guy worked on the iPods, iPhones, and in a sense because they share internals the iPad. And having absorbed the design and manufacturing culture of Apple he essentially would have it no other way at his new company. That isn't easy—his relatively little company cannot command the scale and resources that Apple routinely does as part of their strategy for success.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of thermostats in my house. When we moved in I changed them to "set back" thermostats—they are "programmable" and so allow you to adjust energy use automatically based on the time of day and day of the week. Sadly, in my house, the heating and air systems are completely separate. And worse there are additional individual heat systems as well. So it goes a little something like this…</p>

<p>There's three zones for the main hydronic heat. Two upstairs (bedrooms vs. living area/dining room) and another zone downstairs in the spare bedroom. There's a radiant system in the kitchen, although it turns out to be more for joy than because the kitchen needs the heat. We didn't know when we redid the kitchen and pulled out the main system heat, so we didn't risk having a cold, uncomfortable kitchen. There's also a gas fireplace downstairs that serves two purposes. It adds warmth and joy to the play room where again we pulled out the main system heat. It also runs when there is no power so that room because *the* living space when power goes out for any length of time. Lastly the central air conditioning system is single zone and on its own thermostat.</p>

<p>That's six thermostats, three systems and two pumps. And while some careful programming makes it all work, the system is not smart, it can't react to change. What I'd really like is main control that is informed that we're home and our desired temp is x this time of year. Also, obviously the related settings for when we're not home, and when we arrive home so that it can start warming or cooling the house in advance. It should also know the outside temp, so it can adjust to changing conditions. It would be nice if nest can manage all this… and maybe it can now, but I have no idea as of yet. And no, I haven't ordered one, the current model may not help with this overall problem.</p>

<p><img style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="http://turnings.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-10-at-9-26-27-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2011 11 10 at 9 26 27 PM" border="0" width="364" height="349" /></p>

<p>But why the big embrace from so many? Because it's pretty looking? Sure, to some degree. Because it begins to act like we think appliances should in 2011? No doubt. But I think there's more. I think people are also applauding another company producing technology that also cares about aesthetics and simplicity. Unlike my current thermostats all of which have a beavy of buttons and switches and no intelligence, Nest's thermostat has one dial and one button, a bunch of sensors, and two forms of connectivity.</p>

<p>Nest is a child of Apple and Steve. Twitter and Square are as well although less directly, and in mostly software. They are about delivering the critical functions for a service in a smart way, and reducing the "options" by making smart decisions. They are "designed".</p>

<p>People are embracing that more than anything. I just replaced my doorbell switch. I used an inexpensive piece of junk. I've looked for doorbell switches and found quite few. Some seem wonderfully modern looking. Others have gee whiz LED lights. But for the cost, none of them did something that made me think this is worth the trouble it's going to be to install. They didn't take notice of where the average home owner would have to install the thing.</p>

<p>I want my washer and dryer to be able to send me a notification when they're cycle's are done. I want the water softener to tell me when it's running low on salt. It's 2011. </p>

<p>I watch houses get "stick" built the same way they were 100 years ago. Sure, a few products are different, but the techniques haven't generally improved. There are better answers now. There are better systems* (see below). What is more simple than a house that doesn't need a lot of heating or cooling? The change that we feel when we carry our smart phones is the change we want for all aspects of our lives. And it now up to the next generation of people who have experienced the effects of aesthetics and simplicity in design and the power it has for so many to take a leading role in changing the world with insanely great products. People have raised concerns about Apple's future. I'm not concerned because there's momentum there. People have resources and embedded knowledge. Apple will be fine for years. What's more important to me is to see the same passion and care for design that goes into the Apple products now get going in other companies. And with Nest, it seems they are starting to do so.</p>

<hr />

<p>* <a href="http://bensonwood.com/">Bensonwood</a>’s OBPlusWall: What sets Bensonwood apart is the attention to energy performance, green materials, and rigorous building science. At the heart of this system is the OBPlusWall (OB for “Open-Built”). These factory-built (panelized) walls are framed using 9.5-inch-deep I-studs filled with R-35 dense-pack cellulose insulation, then clad with exterior moisture-resistant OSB sheathing (with taped joints). Advanced gasket technology is used for air sealing, detailing is provided to minimize thermal bridging, a drainage plane is installed on the exterior, and integral baseboard raceways are provided on the interior for electrical and data cables to eliminate wall penetrations for wiring.</p>

<p>The computer modeling not only controls the exact design and fabrication of these wall panels, but even identifies the proper placement of nylon straps for hoisting the (heavy) modules into place on the jobsite. All this is done with a minimum of waste through material optimization and factory fabrication. OBPlusWall modules ship to the jobsite with windows installed and sometimes also with siding, though for some projects the builder chooses to handle more of the finish work on-site.
The companion to the R-35 wall system is a standard R-38 roof system, also insulated with cellulose. Where performance goals demand, Bensonwood can go a lot further with energy performance—by using deeper I-joists and including additional insulation components in the wall and roof systems.</p>

<p>Recently  the company was finishing a house designed to Passive House standards. This walls will have an additional 3.5 inches of cellulose on the interior and two inches of polyisocyanurate on the exterior, to achieve approximately R-60 performance. That project was slowed down because advanced Passive House windows took some time to arrive from Germany—one of the complications with creating state-of-the-art buildings today.</p>

<hr />

<p>PS I worked on a project with NYSERDA, at the energy company where I once toiled, to see if energy use behavior would change via smart meters that relayed the daily market fluctuations. The smart meters eliminated the "social" pricing we're used to paying for energy. We pay the same price all day and night though the actual cost of energy fluctuates based on demand like any other commodity market. The idea was to find out whether people would react to this awareness and do the most energy expensive things when energy costs were lower. It was interesting, but ultimately didn't carry enough information for people to make informed decisions. (You really needed to know how much something was going to cost. If I run the dishwasher now, what does that cost versus running it in the middle of the night?)</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/reviews/2011/11/kindle-fire/all/1">Is This Really the Tablet Everyone’s Talking About?</a>: All of the reviews seem to agree on the main points: the Kindle Fire is best at video playback, not very good for reading, mediocre at web browsing, and acceptable for playing a handful of Android games.

Given its strength as a video-playback device, though, Amazon really should have given it more storage. One of the most common use-cases for watching video on tablets is on airplanes or while commuting, neither of which reliably offer Wi-Fi fast enough for streaming video. Ask any iPad owner who watches a lot of video if 6 GB would be enough storage.

<p><a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/stevepain">Steve Jobs and the Founder’s Pain</a>: And that’s why I like Jony Ive. He too clearly feels that pain (he once insisted they hold up an entire product launch because he didn’t like the polish on the screws) but he doesn’t lash out at people about it. Instead, he sits down with the people involved and works to fix the problem until they get it just right.</p>

<p>But does it require so much pain? My hope is that I can be just as exacting, demand work just as good, without emotionally destroying people in the process. I want to be a perfectionist and a nice guy. I want to be Jony Ive. I hope it works — for my sake, and Apple’s.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[As I've said before. I feel the same way. Sociopath or no, I've certainly done my fair share of yelling and bi-polaresque it's great/sucks sort of thing. And still the hardest part remains finding the passion and will to care at that level and yet not allow that to create pain for  others. It may not be Ive's nature, but it is a part of many of us. We can all do better, and learn from those who don't try to control this.]</cite> <br />

<p><a href="http://www.winterspeak.com/2011/10/occupy-wall-street.html">Occupy Wall Street</a>: The problem is not the end of the industrial age, the problem is a lack of aggregate demand. We have a lack of aggregate demand because finance is mismanaged, both at the industrial level ("Finance industry") and at the Governmental level ("deficit spending" and "financial regulation"). The reason that finance is systemically mismanaged is because the academic paradigm of finance is simply wrong. Economics professors are not good at accounting, they consider it beneath them, so they simply do not know that their macroeconomic models do not follow double-entry bookkeeping and are therefore wrong.

Accountants don't notice that macroeconomics is wrong because they imaginationless grinds.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Right or wrong Zimran never pulls punches.]</cite> <br />

We want our toys cheap, and if some brown or yellow kids have to suffer, well, what can you do? For every point you give Steve for Foxconn, we deserve at least a half point, if not more than a point. We, the american consumer demanded this stuff as cheaply as possible, and now that Apple and other companies are delivering, we suddenly get a case of the vapors about the ugly details? Don't ever learn how candy is made.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[All design is about compromise. Some of those compromises can be ethical.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/11/stop_censorship">Stop Censorship</a>: <p>Today, Congress holds hearings on the first American Internet censorship system as part of SOPA and the PROTECT IP Act. There are a lot of different ways to characterize these bills, but the thing that sticks out to me is that these even though these bills were designed to protect big copyright players—people I have no love for even though I make part of my living by making content—they go one step further and enable massive censorship tools, the kind of which would be valuable to any totalitarian government.</p>

<div>[vimeo http://www.vimeo.com/31100268 w=500&amp;h=281]<div style="width:500px;"> (watch on <a href="http://vimeo.com/31100268">Vimeo</a>)</div></div>


<p>We’ve already got enough of those tools, such as the Patriot Act, which have been abused to our detriment. We don’t need another one, no matter what the good excuse. Not to mention that protecting big copyright holders is a piss poor excuse. Make no mistake about it, these provisions do nothing to help the creative class. Instead, it puts sites like Vimeo and Flickr at risk. It puts FaceBook and YouTube at risk. It puts any blog at risk.</p>

<p><a href="http://americancensorship.org/">Learn more</a>. Now. <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org/pipa/">Act now</a>. Quickly. Call your congressfolk. Don’t leave it to somebody else.</p>

If the Fire sells anywhere near its target volumes, Amazon has hijacked the Android app retail channel for the long term: most sales of Android tablet software will be through the Amazon Appstore, and if your app isn’t there, it’s effectively invisible to the Android tablet userbase.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I can't wait to see what happens next.

<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2011/11/22/the_pummeling_pages">The Pummeling Pages</a>: I’d like to think so. If you’re appealing to readers, remember that you’re appealing to people who like reading black-and-white words on a page, more-or-less.

Because for now it’s insane. Presenting good articles in the hope of attracting readers, and then making the site do everything it can to shoo away those readers, is plumb nuts.</p><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[I've said this for years in my previous gig.

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.scottkelby.com/blog/2011/archives/22903">An Open Letter To Adobe Systems « Scott Kelby's Photoshop Insider Blog » Photoshop &amp; Digital Photography Techniques, Tutorials, Books, Reviews &amp; More</a>: While I understand that Adobe needs to make business decisions based on how it sees market conditions, I feel the timing of this new pricing structure is patently unfair to your customers (and our members). Here’s why: You didn’t tell us up front. You didn’t tell us until nearly the end of the product’s life cycle, and now you’re making us buy CS5.5 for just a few months on the chance that we might want to buy CS6 at a discount when it’s released. Otherwise, we have to pay the full price as if we were never Adobe customers at all.</p>

<p>Those users who didn’t upgrade to CS5 or 5.5, either couldn’t afford the upgrade, or couldn’t justify the upgrade, or they would already be on CS5 or 5.5. But now you’re kind of holding us hostage—you’re making us buy something we don’t need now, just so we will still have the option to get something that we may want (CS6) when it is released without buying it all over again from scratch. You’re playing hardball with your customers—either upgrade twice or you’re out.</p></blockquote>

<a href="http://inrng.com/2011/11/the-road-you-ride-on/">The road you ride on</a>: <blockquote><p>We cannot credit a single person for inventing roads but Pierre-Marie-Jérôme Trésaguet deserves a mention. A French engineer, he sat down to write guidelines for the construction of roads. In 1775 he became Inspecteur Générale for roads and bridges in France and the country began updating paths and tracks. Trésaguet insisted on excavating the ground, installing a layer of large rocks and then adding finer layers of gravel on top, all with drainage channels by the side. Like that, horse-drawn carriages could ride smoothly across mud-free roads as water would now drain away.</p>

<p>The next prominent name in early road construction is John Loudon McAdam, a Scot whose name lives on today thanks to macadam and tarmac. Macadam is the use of soil and stone that is then rollered into place to form a compacted layer that resists the passage of traffic, horseshoes included. This technique is still in use the world over and today cycling races use such roads in the strade bianche of Tuscany or the Colle delle Finestre, a regular in the Giro d’Italia  which was built for the Italian army.</p></blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Imagine if the road could be patented (It no doubt could if it were "invented" today). Evolutionary development happens all the time. Real leaps in understanding, design, or application are rare. Chip seal roads suck because they are "tweeners"… neither gravel road nor pavement. They catch you unaware, lulling you to sleep with well packed sections when a sudden pile of loose stone or some fresh oil does you in. feh.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://chipotle.tumblr.com/post/13509205082">No, Michael Arrington, you are not Jack Sparrow</a>: <blockquote>“But the real payoff is the pirate life itself!” The argument for doing the insane startup work is the slim potential the team sells for $100M or more, but really, you’re in it because you love risk. You love the lifestyle! You love the sailing around the world and visiting exotic new ports of call and the rum and the wenches and oh wait we’re not actually talking about pirates you idiot.

Real pirates tended to be out-of-work privateers who had nowhere else to go, criminals trying to escape the law, or the desperately poor; their careers at sea rarely lasted more than a few years and usually ended in death. The number who retired comfortably in their mid-30s to start investment funds to back new up-and-coming pirates is roughly zero. But in Arrington’s “fantasy pirate world,” they’re all Jack Sparrow.

There may well be an “entrepreneur lifestyle” which roughly corresponds to the pirate lifestyle. I know a serial entrepreneur who seems to always be traveling to meet with high-power executives and VCs, to make deals over lunch and dinner and wine and bocce, and I don’t doubt for a minute that he puts in 80+ hour weeks or that it isn’t genuinely hard work. But the lifestyle that people are “crying and whining about” is, ultimately, not the entrepreneur lifestyle. It’s the first-hire lifestyle. Arrington may genuinely believe that all hard work is roughly identical, but it isn’t. The hard work he put in building TechCrunch was finding and managing employees, writing, and a lot of meetings with Internet movers and shakers. Surely that is hard work, but it’s no more comparable to an 80+ hour week of sitting at (or under) a desk coding until you have RSI than it is to tomato farming.

What brought on Arrington’s righteous anger was the complaints that people like, well, me had about Zynga reneging on stock options. He thinks that’s just whining. Bullshit. Zynga is whining. And let’s not pretend that Zynga is a Google or Twitter or a JWZ-era Netscape—or even a TechCrunch. They’re a Skinner box. I won’t go so far as to say that Mark Pincus should be first against the wall when the revolution comes, but he should be sleeping under a desk.

Pincus started—started—where Uncle Mike is now: as a venture capitalist. The material wealth both of them enjoy came from work very far removed from first-hire engineering. Arrington may fancy himself a pirate, but he hasn’t ever had to worry about scurvy.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Too brilliant for me not to quote so heavily. It's worth reading the entire piece. There's another confusion taking place as well. The one where someone writes code or has an idea they're so passionate about that they can't stop doing it. That happens as well, but it's only slightly more common than winning the lottery, hitting it big with a startup, or becoming a rock star considering how hard it is to maintain that level of intensity over any length of time.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://thecynicalmusician.com/2010/01/the-paradise-that-should-have-been/">The Paradise That Should Have Been | The Cynical Musician</a>: <blockquote>What about a band? Let’s just quickly go over the same calculations for a standard four-piece rock group (vocals, guitar, bass, drums):

Amazon and iTunes, single-track downloads: 7,250 a month; 87,000 a year.
CD Baby full-album downloads: 619 a month; 7,433 a year.
eMusic single-track downloads: 13,567 a month; 162,807 a year.
Rhapsody streams: 509,890 a month; 6,118,681 a year.
Last.fm plays: 30,933,333 a month; 371,200,000 a year.
Aside: Even if you got the entire Chinese web-connected population to listen to your song on Last.fm just once, you still probably wouldn’t meet your annual quota.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[And that's for minimum wage and assumes no cost in the production of the music. It is to weep. Keep asking me why I no longer try and make a living in music… simple really. I found that I had to do other things to make a living, which was defeating the point. I also never thought the "Internet" was going to improve this situation in terms of sales or royalties directly. I saw it as an opportunity to market to larger audience more easily. And that it is. But that does not convert directly into sales where aggregation and a direct relationship with your audience is important. iTunes sitting between you and your audience doesn't allow for this… or any other service of that sort. That's why I think <a href="https://squareup.com/">making credit card transactions simple</a> is so key right now.]</cite>

<a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/12/01/what-purpose-do-book-publishers-serve/">What purpose do book publishers serve?</a>: <blockquote>Self-publishing often means Amazon is in control

The author also mentions her reluctance to become “Amazon’s bitch,” as she puts it, by making her work only available through the online retailer and its mobile platform. While self-publishers see themselves as fighting the system, she notes that they are really just exchanging one large corporate entity for another:

I don’t mind if someone else chooses to read my work electronically, just as I don’t mind if Amazon is one of the places to purchase my work; I’m simply wary of Amazon monopolizing the reading landscape.

But one of the biggest reasons Lepucki gives for not wanting to self-publish is also one of the best weapons good publishers have in their fight not to be disintermediated by Amazon, and that is the relationship that forms between a publisher — and the editors who handle a book — and an author. As she puts it, even the notes on her rejected manuscript from the sub-editor who handled it showed “these professionals are valuable to the process of book-making.” For every publisher who treats their writers so badly that they switch to Amazon, there are likely others who value that relationship and work hard to improve it.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[The problem is that entering into that relationship is costly so the big publishers have a lot of gatekeepers in place and often won't even look at a book that doesn't run through the industry mill. I don't disagree that trading in one corporate owner for another is problematic. Unfortunately, that is the simple answer if you don't want to do the work of building an individual relationship with your readers. Maybe do it as part of a plan. For example, it is often suggested that you publish  a blog etc. in order to build an audience, and then the potential to earn money rises with the audience. Essentially you get to sell the "second" act, or the second book, etc. But maybe you can use Amazon to build that audience and then do something different with follow-ups so that you don't lose all control.]</cite>

<a href="http://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2011nl/nov/jobs.htm">McDougall Newsletter: November 2011 - Why Did Steve Jobs Die?</a>: <blockquote>Neither Steve Jobs’ vegan lifestyle nor turning down surgery were the acts of an insane man. Rather both decisions demonstrate his rationality, genius, intuitiveness, and internal strength to stand up for what he knew to be right. The truth may now give family and friends some peace of mind. Also those who tied Jobs’ cancer to his vegan diet can now go back to healthy eating. Understanding and publicizing the cause of his cancer should also focus more attention on the serious harms caused by chemicals used in the electronic industries.

Consider the misfortune that happened to Steve Jobs, one of the wealthiest and most powerful men to have ever lived. A little cost-free, harmless, and honest counsel would have greatly improved the physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing of Jobs—especially during the last 8 years of his life, when he gave so much to us.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Interesting stuff if only conjecture.]</cite><br />

<a href="http://antirez.com/post/take-advantage-of-redis-adding-it-to-your-stack.html">How to take advantage of Redis just adding it to your stack</a>: <blockquote>However one thing I like about Redis is that it can solve a lot of problems just adding it to your stack to do things that were too slow or impossible with your existing database. This way you start to take confidence with Redis in an incremental way, starting to use it just to optimize or to create new features in your application. This blog post explores a few use cases showing how people added Redis to existing environments to take advantage of Redis set of features. I'll not report specific use cases with site names and exact configurations, I'll just try to show you class of problems that Redis can solve without being your primary database. 
</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[It's the way I got Redis in the door with a team very wary (and weary) of adding anything to the stack.]</cite>

Look no further than this year’s Pokey awards, given out annually by the Straphangers Campaign. Manhattan buses, as usual, top the list of the year’s slowest service.

The Pokey this year goes to the M50 crosstown bus, which averaged a mere 3.5 miles per hour at noon (imagine it at rush hour!). The 14 slowest lines are all in Manhattan, with the Bronx’s Bx19, which runs down Southern Boulevard and into Harlem, clocking in as the slowest bus in the other boroughs.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Of course, I had many runs in with the M50 while empty (and I presume going home). The drivers were super aggressive, cutting off other drivers, not letting anyone into the lane. And they make a left hand turn onto 9A/12th from the right hand lane of 49th street. I know the turning radius is large, but there was no communication of their intent. It was always dangerous to watch as time after time unknowing people would pull up on the M50s left assuming that the bus was going to make a right turn… so a big NY raspberry in the direction of the M50.]</cite> <br />

And then the car turns in front of me. Its shocks make a hiccuping sound as it bounces into the driveway of the grocery store.

<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/adventure-journal/~3/kiqaVp4V3W4/">Fresh Goods: Soul Poles Bamboo Ski Poles</a>: <blockquote><p>Everything old is new again: Soul Poles has gone back to one of the original materials used to make ski poles, bamboo, and there are compelling arguments in its favor, aside from the fact that the poles look bitchin’. The fledgling brand, launched by World Cup skiers Erik Schlopy and Bryon Friedman, makes the sticks by hand in Utah from sustainable bamboo and mostly recycled materials, including a recycled polypro strap, recycled plastic in the basket, and 80 percent recycled aluminum in the tip. SP is also a member of One Percent for the Planet and Protect Our Winters and good on ‘em for it.</p>

<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/firefox-faces-uncertain-future-as-google-deal-apparently-ends/4241">Firefox faces uncertain future as Google deal apparently ends</a>: <blockquote>It might be worthwhile for Google just to keep Microsoft from buying that promotion for Bing. Because if anyone’s willing to throw massive piles of money at gaining marketshare that isn’t worth anywhere near what they spent to gain it, it’s Microsoft. Given the history between Firefox and Internet Explorer, though, it would be pretty entertaining if Microsoft made such a deal, effectively sponsoring Firefox’s continued development.

I’m a bit sad for Firefox. It used to be the fast, powerful, progressive browser that finally broke IE’s era of stagnant dominance and saved web developers’ sanity. Now, it’s a bloated, slow, unstable monster that’s often a pain in this web developer’s ass.

It’s losing marketshare to Chrome for very good reasons. There’s no place for it in mobile, where most of the growth and action is happening in the industry, and most of their other recent attempts at new platforms and products have fizzled out.

I’m not sure Firefox can be saved. It might continue for a long time as a fringe browser choice, like Opera, but I don’t see how its marketshare will ever increase again.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[It certainly lost a lot of ground with my circle of developers. They went from using it as their only browser, to also using it alongside of others. Trust me to know these guys, that's two miles of bad road. Ya know? Onward!]</cite> <br />

and second, I think there's a parallel to the broken windows theory here. Broken Windows asserts that in cities with small acts of vandalism and unrepaired facades, crime goes up. The Christmas Light corollary might be that in towns (or online communities) where there's a higher rate of profit-free community contribution, happiness and productivity go up as well.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Nice.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is there something morally pure or preferable about a painful intricate construction, rather than the brisk, functional way most people toss off a task?</p>

<p>Is there a beauty in seriousness?</p>

<p>It would appear it is something that I can’t fail to be touched by. A shorthand lesson plan on how I wish to live.</p>

<p>When there is no compromise with expediency, no taking for granted of power structures, nothing but rigorous honesty and tireless interrogation; there is some feeling or hope that if I could put every single thing under the sun into this moment I could head off sorrow, frustration, resentment, missed communication, and thwarted ambition.</p>

<p>It is way easier of course to walk past, to not examine, to not take apart: There is a social use in seeing an ambulance rushing by without imagining who is inside it, in buying a quart of milk without thinking too deeply about the guy behind the counter, or how the cow was treated. The fish who is thinking obsessively “What is water?” is, no doubt, a little less likely to swim very far.</p>

<p>Still, every time I tinker with some aspect of my life working toward it being, acceptable, professional, workable, move-on-able, I think "Maybe I’ll do it a little better this time."</p>

<p>And I've come to realize that it is that which I cherish in people, companies, workshops, and craft. Making it a priority that the every day approach is "How can I do this better this time?" and is a fundamental path. The warp and weft of process. The chance to make the work, the hour, the day sacred in some truest sense, because through that improvement, we succeed at seizing the moment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-06/monsanto-corn-may-be-failing-to-kill-bugs-epa-says.html">Monsanto Corn May Be Failing to Kill Bugs, EPA Says - Businessweek</a>: <blockquote>Monsanto should enact a remedial action plan in fields where resistance to its Bt insecticide is suspected, the EPA said. That includes having growers use conventional pesticide to kill adult rootworm beetles late in the season and alternate pest control methods in the following season.

Monsanto tested rootworms for resistance in Nebraska, Illinois and Iowa and should expand the monitoring to Colorado, Minnesota, South Dakota and western Wisconsin because questions about the performance of Bt corn extends to all seven states, the EPA said in the memo.

Monsanto’s most advanced resistance problem is with crops engineered to tolerate its Roundup herbicide. Weeds that are no longer killed by Roundup have invaded 14 million acres of U.S. cotton, soybean and corn, according to Syngenta AG, a Swiss chemical maker. A Dow Chemical Co. study this year found as many as 20 million acres of corn and soybeans may be infested.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[What an incredible mess is being made with this. Life always finds a way. Try your best not to buy and eat these products (easier said than done, I know).]</cite>

And yet it is obliged (as FedEx and UPS are not) to visit every mailbox, no matter how remote, six days a week. This has driven the average cost of each piece of mail up from 34 cents in 2006 to 41 cents. Yet the post is not allowed to raise prices (of stamps and such) willy-nilly; a 2006 law set formulas for that. So in effect, the post cannot control either its costs or its revenues.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[New phrase for hamstrung projects where the business wants to control all sides of the delivery triangle (cost/time/features) "Don't postal the project."]</cite>

<a href="http://wundasworld.blogspot.com/2011/12/i-find-talking-about-creating-software.html">Wunda's World: Clarifying purpose</a>: <blockquote>How can we do this? By understanding and buying into what we are creating and how we see it experienced. We can create a mission, vision and values to clarify and create distinction.

The mission statement is all about purpose. Its about the problem you are trying to solve, the information you are trying to share and/or the service you are trying to provide. Its about the long term goals.

On the other side, the vision statement is an abstraction of the experience. It can include words like fun, simple, quality, quickly, stable, reliable, responsive, etc. It does not include ideas like color schemes, mechanics, technology specifics or other implementation details.

Time can also be spent on value statements (users own their information, we strive to directly connect with and respond to user feedback, all user feedback is valid, etc)

Continue drilling down into these ideas until everyone knows what they are doing, are excited to work towards the goals and know in their hearts they are working on an effort they accept fully.

For new teams, taking time to manifest an understanding of team dynamics, quality and creativity with as much openness and honesty as possible can help ensure the best "good-enough" software gets created in a way that is enjoyable, sustainable and collaborative.

Finally, read these statements every morning. When discussions become long, unclear or hostile, refer back to them. Use them as a method to stay detached to what is no longer serving and focused on the underlying issues.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Well said!]</cite>

<a href="http://thecynicalmusician.com/2011/11/cut-paste-innovate-the-business-of-stolen-art/">Cut, Paste, Innovate – The Business of (Stolen) Art | The Cynical Musician</a>: <blockquote>The reality is that even the best tools are seldom enough and that although the Internet has solved some problems, the biggest ones still remain – the chief of those being the ability to make your existence known to a wider audience. Plus, the same tools that enable you to enter the market at lower cost also make it easier for bad actors to do so – lifting your work in the process. If Love Lieberman was able to make any money from Art4Love, he did so by exploiting the standard pirate advantages – costless access to a large and varied body of work and the risk-minimsation that comes with it. He could even tailor the site’s offer to reflect the results achieved – phasing out disappointing works, introducing new ones and promoting those that found the most buyers. No individual artist could do the same, since they’d be restricted to the work that they had produced themselves.

Whenever an online business decides to profit from piracy – and gets called out on it – we hear the usual suspects crying out that “rent-seeking Big Media” is trying to crush “innovation”. I put it to you that most of the time what we’re actually seeing is just the “cut (or copy), paste” bit.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Powerful piece. Rings true to me.]</cite>

<a href="http://waldo.jaquith.org/blog/2011/12/impractical-cheeseburger/">On the Impracticality of a Cheeseburger</a>: <blockquote><p>Waldo Jaquith:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A cheeseburger cannot exist outside of a highly developed,
post-agrarian society. It requires a complex interaction between a
handful of vendors — in all likelihood, a couple of dozen — and
the ability to ship ingredients vast distances while keeping them
fresh. The cheeseburger couldn’t have existed until nearly a
century ago as, indeed, <em>it did not</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Love the Sagan quote at the end.</p>

<a title="Permanent link to ‘On the Impracticality of a Cheeseburger’" href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/06/waldo-jaquith"> ★ </a>
</div></blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[While an interesting thought experiment it doesn't ring entirely true. Sure there can be problems with the seasonality of vegetables, but cheese making would have been a continual pursuit for those who did it. And while animal rennet is certainly most common, there are vegetable used rennets as well. etc. etc. The truth seems closer to "it takes a village" than do it all yourself. Maybe you hot house something, trade for some cheese, and no doubt, pre-freezer slaughtering a cow or a sheep would require multiple families because a single (unless very large) family couldn't eat the animal fast enough… I try and enjoy each season for what it brings in all senses. The weather, the food, the holidays. So I think the effort to completely raise the entire meal from the ground is cool, much as planting trees to turn into furniture later is cool. But that path is long, and life is fleeting.]</cite> <br />

He was 96. His son Charles confirmed his death.

In more than 100 movies, Mr. Morgan played Western bad guys, characters with names like Rocky and Shorty, loyal sidekicks, judges, sheriffs, soldiers, thugs and police chiefs.

On television, he played Officer Bill Gannon with a phlegmatic but light touch to Jack Webb’s always-by-the-book Sgt. Joe Friday in the updated “Dragnet,” from 1967 to 1970.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[RIP. Loved the characters he played. Amazing career.]</cite>

<a href="http://chipotle.tumblr.com/post/13834132511">Paypal: feel the love</a>: <blockquote>You’ve probably read about (or even felt) the anger over Paypal <a href="http://www.regretsy.com/2011/12/05/cats-1-kids-0/">“stealing money” from Regretsy</a>, which is only the latest in a series of things they’ve done that have pissed the Internet off. I suspect, given the attention this is getting, they’ll fix this. (Unlike them cutting off Wikileaks, this time Paypal is as coming as close to stealing from orphans before Christmas as one can get without writing a Dickens story.) This will quiet down. Then, within six months, they’ll do something else to piss the Internet off.

In no particular order, here’s a few random thoughts.

The key to understanding Paypal is this: Their policies in dealing with their customers are all crafted with the assumption that their customers are out to screw them. It’s not that they don’t want to do business with you, it’s that they don’t trust you. Ever. Under any circumstance. They want your money, but they hate you.

They hate you because in a measurable percentage of their transactions, people are trying to screw them over. As the cliché goes, it’s not paranoia when they really are out to get you.

Except that approaching every transaction with that attitude really is paranoia.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[The Internet is young, and we are collectively stupid for supporting organizations like this. Make sure you read the original post which is linked to in the first paragraph. It'll make your blood boil, especially if you follow these stories (and toss in the issues folks have had with Google as well). What a mess.]</cite> <br />

While demonstrating the power of Naval Airplanes it lead way to the end of the might of battleships. It was the day that ratified the people of this country to join in one of the bloodiest and most costly wars we had ever seen. They fought at home and on foreign fronts for our safety, our rights as individuals, and our freedom. May people remember what happened that day December 7th, 1941, the lives that were lost and the families hurt. May we never forget what happened in that War so history doesn’t repeat itself.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Indeed.]</cite> <br />

Ah, and about the gain being some kind of feature only exciting for we code nerds and having zero effects on how a system works, please read my next article in a few days, we are programmers and we need a revolution.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Stay tuned. There's more of this scintillating tech stuff coming. (It is important if you're a developer, but otherwise it's totally in the weeds, and should remain there atmo.) There is a larger lesson to be gleaned from the dependencies issue. If something requires that you do something complex for little or no gain, it's probably the wrong thing to do. It should be noted that we often completely organize our lives in this complicated fashion for little gain. Worthy of more thought.]</cite>

<p><strong>We had no time.</strong> If we had thought long and hard before we built our system, it probably would have been too complicated and wouldn’t have worked. We also might have thought of a more sayable name…</p>
All of the lessons that we’ve learned through our journey are baked into our organizations culture. We question assumptions and we treasure disruption.

What differentiates us from animals is the fact that we can listen to other people’s dreams, fears, joys, sorrows, desires and defeats — and they in turn can listen to ours.

Many people make the mistake of confusing information with knowledge. They are not the same thing. Knowledge involves the interpretation of information. Knowledge involves listening.

So if I am right that we are storytelling creatures, and as long as we permit ourselves to be quiet for a while now and then, the eternal narrative will continue.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[We also listen first and speak second in our development.]</cite>

<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/12/fbi-carrier-iq">FBI Says Carrier IQ May Be Used in ‘Law Enforcement Proceedings’</a>: <blockquote><p>Andy Greenberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After a video surfaced that seemed to show the software logging
keystrokes and monitoring data traffic on the more than 140
million phones on it’s installed by default, Morisy had <a href="http://www.muckrock.com/foi/view/united-states-of-america/manuals-or-documentation-regarding-accessing-carrier-iq-data-fbi/947/">asked the
Bureau</a> for any “manuals, documents or other written guidance
used to access or analyze data gathered by programs developed or
deployed by Carrier IQ.”</p>

<p>The FBI responded that the material couldn’t be provided, and
cited an exemption to the Freedom of Information law for
situations in which handing over documents “could reasonably be
expected to interfere with law enforcement proceedings.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ugh. Not sure how to see this as anything other than confirmation of our worst fears about this Carrier IQ stuff.</p>

Those of us who write for a living know how precious it is when you get “in the zone” while writing. The zone is that mental place where the words just flow as fast as you can type them. I find I get in the zone far more often on the iPad than on other computers. I attribute that to my focus being forced to the task at hand, and that is priceless.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[So everyone that writes this mentions the above "focus" thing and the battery life (it's very long compared to even a current laptop). But here's the thing. Running any app full screen will provide the focus of which they are all so enamored. Some writing apps (for the Mac) were built with exactly this in mind, and completely hide the screen. It's now fairly common on the Mac as many apps support Lion's "full screen mode" which takes the menus off the top, the dock off the bottom or side, and eliminates tool bars etc. So again, other than cool factor, and battery life (what did all we do until now? The horror!) these articles are simply "look at me, I'm cutting edge." articles. I agree that adding a keyboard transforms the feel of an iPad (or iPhone) entirely. And the battery life is gloriously freeing if you're used to the dance of power cords, and timing, and outlets. But the focus thing strikes me as people who had no clue about what as available to them for years. The change, if you can consider it one, is that the iPad doesn't provide a choice about "one thing at time". It is that design decision that they're actually praising. They're embracing the constraint and saying "behold the beauty", even if there are plenty of times it feels in the way. For example, working on a web design where switching back and forth between editor and browser is a back and forth whip saw like action that repeats many times.) But I'm so glad that all these writers who apparently are so undisciplined that they cannot ignore the flashing of their tweets, or the siren call of menu choices have found nirvana. Now if they would just write about something worthwhile, instead of informing us of their modern version of a #2 pencil.]</cite>

<p>PS Don't misunderstand. I love the combination of keyboard and iPad or iPhone, it's a really great way to go for writers and some types of tasks. But it doesn't replace a big screen for everything. It's just a tool, albeit a great one for some tasks.</p>

The revelations of the secret loan program may provide the opportunity for Occupy Wall Street to suggest a few concrete steps that would be difficult to oppose.

First: Demand a hearing where the bank executives have to answer questions—under oath—about the actual negotiations, or lack thereof, that led to these loans; about the actual condition of each of the borrowing banks and whether that condition differed from the public statements made by the banks at the time.

Second: Require the recipient banks to use this previously undisclosed gift—the profit they made by investing this almost interest-free money—to write down the value of mortgages of those who are underwater. The loans to the banks were meant to solve a short-term liquidity problem, not be a source of profits to fund bonuses. Take back the profits and put them to a public use.

Third: Require the government officials responsible for authorizing these loans to explain why there was no effort made to condition these loans on changes in policy that would protect the public going forward.

Fourth: Ask congress to examine every filing and statement made to Congress by the banks about their financial condition and their indebtedness to see if any misrepresentations were made in an effort to hide these trillions of dollars of loans. Misleading Congress can be a felony, and willful deception of the Congress to hide the magnitude of the public bailouts should not go unprosecuted.
Finally: Demand that politicians return all contributions made by the institutions that got hidden loans. Pressure the politicians who continue to feed from the trough of Wall Street, even as they know all too well how the banks and others have gamed the system and the public.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Incredible.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RAYMOND J. LAWRENCE is an Episcopal cleric for 46 years, recently retired Director of Pastoral Care, New York Presbyterian Hospital, and author of numerous opinion pieces in newspapers in the U.S. and wrote the following.
</p>

<div class="entry">
<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2007/12/15/let-s-take-christ-out-of-christmas/">Let’s Take Christ Out of Christmas</a>: <blockquote>Christmas was adopted by Christianity late, by some three hundred years. It was incorporated into Christianity in the 4th century, the same way Friday fish-eating was incorporated and during the same time. (Imperial Romans ate fish on Fridays to honor Venus, the goddess of love, fish being the food of love and sex.) The venerial fish-eating was simply co-opted by Christianity and given a revised rationale, namely that Jesus died on Friday, so one should abstain from eating meat on Friday.

In imperial Rome, the December 25 feast in honor of the Invincible Sun, Sol Invictus, was accompanied by the exchange of gifts, cutting of greens, lighting of candles, and public festivals commemorating new life. The sun, after all, had turned in the sky and was rising earlier and setting later, after the winter solstice.

[snip ed.]

To liberate Christmas from the clutches of Christianity would demonstrate a generosity of spirit on the part of Christians that would set a good example in these times of increasing strife between the various religions of the world.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why do school kids have one computing experience at home and in their personal lives, and a completely out of touch, ancient experience at school? I'll get back to that.</p>

<div class="entry">
<a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/highlights/stevejobs/video/">Steve Jobs in 1980</a>: <blockquote><p>Same vision. Same goals. What he was talking about then applies almost completely to what Apple is doing today. (<a href="https://twitter.com/drwave/status/146744497269784576">Via Michael B. Johnson</a>.)</p>
</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[<a title="Permanent link to ‘Steve Jobs in 1980’" href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/13/steve-jobs">Gruber</a> pointed to this video from 1980 and if you're a student of Steve Jobs you'll have heard these themes before. The condor &amp; the bicycle for example was very common in his talks from those years. Two things struck me as I watched this.

Something struck me at about 10:18 in the video. Steve is talking about how different the experience is when there is one computer to an individual not, what was until then, common—many people sharing one computer.  Despite our collective understanding of this, made clear by the shear number of computers available to schools so many of us, most schools have one computer shared by many students for short periods of time as a curricular addition. Gym, art, music, computers. Asides in the daily lives of students everywhere. This is clearly ridiculous in age of iTouches, smartphones, iPads, texting, tweeting etc. How could we possibly not have computers in the hands of students all day every day.

<a href="http://speirs.org/blog/tag/theipadproject">Some schools</a> courtesy of some smart administrators are getting this right. Integrating computing into the curriculum at its base, not as a course of study. That's key. The teachers must use them for their coursework. Homework, communication, the entire experience of school must be integrated. Don't teach "computers" in the classroom, use computers in the classroom.

The second thing, an aside really, is that recordings will *not* be scarce in the future. Almost everything that someone does publicly will most likely have a recording made and available for the future. This can be good, and bad. The bad that I'm thinking about is that it might be harder for people to evolve if their past is so well documented. The good is obvious, that we'll be able to study people in far greater depth, in the direct way that seeing an image of them provides.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1800674/new-york-city-big-apps-roadify-sportify?partner=rss">New York City's Digital Deficiency</a>: <blockquote>You are circling the block yet again, desperately seeking a parking space--and then you remember there's an app for that. You whip out your phone and pull up Roadify, the high-profile winner of New York City's second BigApps contest, which is supposed to provide a real-time list of parking spaces near your location. You watch as Roadify loads and quickly discover there are no free parking spaces within a 10-mile radius of where you are currently circling the block. This shouldn't surprise you because there are usually almost no parking spaces listed in the app, rendering it fairly useless. Then, as you slam on your breaks to avoid hitting a pedestrian, you remember that driving while using your phone is difficult, dangerous, and often illegal.
And this is the app that won?
Undeterred by Roadify's failure, the city announced the third installment of the BigApps contest in September, in which the city awards $50,000 in cash to the best app that uses city data. So far the first two contests have yielded apps that have received a fair amount of media attention but have lagged in user adoption. Sportify, another winner that garnered a lot of press, also relies on a critical mass of users to function. It, too, is a great idea in principle (find people near you who want to play pickup sports!), which has yet to catch on. All of this is the predictable result of the city's approach to digital development, which focuses on plenty of sizzle, not much steak. It's time for the city to deeply explore what New York's citizens actually need, and the ways in which those citizens are likely to behave.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[How unsurprising.]</cite>

<a href="http://sashadichter.wordpress.com/2011/12/14/3-thoughts-on-generosity/">3 Thoughts on Generosity</a>: <blockquote><strong>Generosity alone is not enough</strong>

Generosity is nothing more and nothing less than the foundation upon which we build. We won’t solve the big problems of the world just by opening our hearts.  That is a dangerous dream, because the stakes are much too high.  Yet without generosity too many doors are closed, too much judgment creeps in.  Without generosity empathy is not given a space in which to grow and we experience the terrible misfortune of undervaluing the gifts we have been given.  In so doing we run the risk of forgetting that each of us has something important to offer in creating solutions big and small.

To me, generosity is an active orientation towards the world and all its messiness.  It is a refusal to walk by, to shut down, to pretend that if we just keep our heads down everything will turn out OK.  It won’t, at least not without all of us.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[On point.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/12/09/the-diagnosis.html">The diagnosis</a>: <blockquote>I do not know all of what's ahead. I know a little. I know that there is a new kind of life on the other side of this thing. A changed mind and body. A new appreciation of time, and breath, and health, and life, and loved ones.

The gravity in this place is different. I've spoken to others who've traveled out here, too, and returned home safely. When you become one of them, you learn quickly that you share a language others can't understand.

The trick, these fellow travelers tell me, is to accept the not knowing and find your equilibrium in that new gravity. Calm the mind. Find your balance out on the cold planet, whether or not you know the next step, or the date of the next appointment, or what good or bad news the Technetium-99 isotopes floating around in your blood during the last scan reveal.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[So painful.]</cite>

<a href="http://blog.millermedeiros.com/2011/11/the-problem-with-css-pre-processors/">The problem with CSS pre-processors | Miller Medeiros</a>: <blockquote>I’ve been considering to use a CSS pre-processor like SASS, LESS, Stylus, etc, for a very long time. Every time someone asked me if I was using any of these tools/languages I would say that I’m kinda used to my current workflow and I don’t really see a reason for changing it since the problems those languages solves are not really the problems I’m having with CSS. Then yesterday I read two blog posts which made me reconsider my point of view so I decided to spend some time today studying the alternatives (once again) and porting some code to check the output and if the languages would really help to keep my code more organized/maintainable and/or if it would make the development process easier (also if they evolved on the past few years).</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[This is one of those issues that pushes a to of buttons and I appreciate that MM went out of the way to try and not start a meaningless flamewar. That said, the piece caught my eye when he got to the postscript "PS: I love CSS, for me it’s one of the most rewarding tasks on a website development, it’s like solving a hard puzzle…". I agree. It's like solving a hard puzzle… and one that provides no business value. It feels like there's a store room where I keep stuff I need to get all the time, but instead of a door, I pile stones in front of the opening. Each time I have to get something I have to unpile the heavy stones, get what I need, and then re-pile the stones. Over and over and over again. That's not good is it? Anyone would suggest a door or moving the stuff somewhere that didn't require all of that unnecessary effort. That's what working with CSS feels like. Considering how similar the web looks overall, it seems silly that we hand generate so much CSS. And the tools being debated are more about making CSS more programmable because that's the way developers think. But if you step back that's not what we need and that's what these preprocessors do. We need to get all this stuff back into the hands of the designers where they can do as they please. The point of collaboration would only exist when crafting something uncommon or unique.]</cite>

		<title>iPhone apps to tune your instrument</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my teachers used to say (minus a lot of removed swear words) If it ain't in tune, it ain't nothin'. With that in mind, two favorite tuners for the iPhone:</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/istrobosoft/id308296029?mt=8">iStrobosoft by Peterson</a> recreates their great tuner which used a strobe light and a spinning wheel to create a great harmonically rich visual display. This iPhone app is an awesome recreation and works superbly, giving you both fine and gross indicators as well as that awesome harmonic stack. You can calibrate it for accuracy, it supports capos and dropped tunings and other reference pitches, has a noise filter, an input boost, and some display settings.</p>

<p>The other is the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/polytune/id364009203?mt=8">polytune from tc electronic</a>. Aimed at guitar players, it allows you to tune all six strings at once, a quick strum is all you need. Start fine tuning one string and the display switches to a finer display along with the pitch. It allows for drop tunings, a range of reference pitch (lots of folks don't use 440 as the reference) and has a setting for bass players as well. there's a couple of display settings for good measure.</p>

<p>Both of these guys support the mic on a phone so tuning an acoustic guitar only requires a somewhat quiet room.</p>

<p>Both are recommended and work really well. It's great to have a such great tuners with me all the time.</p>

<blockquote><p>Teens have officially joined the mobile Data Tsunami, more than tripling mobile data consumption in the past year while maintaining their stronghold as the leading message senders. Using recent data from monthly cell phone bills of 65,000+ mobile subscribers who volunteered to participate in the research, Nielsen analyzed mobile usage trends among teens in the United States. In the third quarter of 2011, teens age 13-17 used an average of  320 MB of data per month on their phones, increasing 256 percent over last year and growing at a rate faster than any other age group. Much of this activity is driven by teen males, who took in 382 MB per month while females used 266 MB.</p>

<div class="entry">
<a href="http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/268">kickingbear» How I’d Build an Apple Television Set</a>: <blockquote>I’ve done a lot of thinking about the Apple TV. For some reason it fascinates me. It’s entirely different from the other applications of software. First, it’s a shared experience rather than a direct experience like a Mac or an iOS device. Second, this shared experience means there’s necessarily an indirection of input — if a screen is big enough to be seen by everyone in the room you’re not going to be close enough to it to mess with it directly. So when the rumours went around of an iOS based Apple TV coming I became intrigued and tossed some ideas back and forth with a friend. Mostly the discussion came down to input methods — what could they do and what’d that mean for the interface? Around that same time Bluetooth 4.0 was ratified and the specification includes a low power mode. I guessed that if the Apple TV had a Bluetooth 4.0 chip then we’d see a new remote, if not we’d likely just stick with what we had.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Interesting thoughts. Still not convinced Apple will do something, but I have no doubt they could if it made business sense.]</cite> <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="entry">
<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2011/12/17/please-no-new-laws/">If you hate Big Government, fight SOPA.</a>: <blockquote><p>Nobody who opposes Big Government and favors degregulation should favor the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">Stop Online Piracy Act, better known as SOPA</a>, or<a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/112%20HR%203261.pdf"> H.R. 3261</a>. It’s a big new <a href="http://volokh.com/2011/12/14/sopa-rope-a-dope/">can of worms</a> that will cripple use of the Net, slow innovation on it, clog the courts with lawsuits, employ litigators in perpetuity and deliver copyright maximalists in the “content” <a title="Business" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business" rel="wikipedia">business</a> a hollow victory for the ages.</p>
<p>A few years back, a former government official confidentially issued a warning to a small group I was part of, which favored some kind of lawmaking around technology. While this isn’t a verbatim quote, it’s pretty close, because it has been burned in my mind ever since: “In the course of my work I have met with nearly every member of Congress. And I can tell you that, with only a handful of exceptions, there are two things none of them understand. One is economics and the other is technology. Now proceed.”</p>
<p>Know-nothing lawmakers are doing exactly that with SOPA. As <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/">Joshua Kopstein</a> says,<em><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/2011/12/16/dear-congress-it-s-no-longer-ok-to-not-know-how-the-internet-works"> Dear Congress, It’s No Longer OK To Not Know How The Internet Works</a></em>.</p>
<p>SOPA is a test for principle for <a title="Member of Congress" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Congress" rel="wikipedia">members of Congress</a>. If you wish to save the Internet, vote against it. If you wish to fight Big Government, vote against it. If you wish to protect friends in the “content” production and distribution business at extreme cost to every other business in the world, vote for it. If you care more about a few businesses you can name and nothing about all the rest of them — which will be whiplashed by the unintended consequences of a bill that limits what can be done on the Internet while not comprehending the Internet at all, vote for it.</p>
</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[Go read the rest of Doc's piece. And then get off your hands and get in touch with your congress people.]</cite> <br />

<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AVc/~3/h7_1tiE9_ds/some-thoughts-on-the-louis-ck-experiment.html">Some Thoughts On The Louis CK "Experiment"</a>: <blockquote>But this can also work for emerging artists. They won't make as much money as Louis CK, but they also don't need to make as large of an investment either. And over time, if their work is good, their audience will grow and the investments they can make and the profits they can make will increase.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[This piece was going OK until he got to the paragraph above. I know he said "emerging" artist, which implies some following already in place. But the truth is that kick starting something like this is really, really, low odds. Like Lotto low. And I'm not saying that everyone has to do a six camera shoot of their gigs. I bet you could get a great shoot done with six IPhones for goodness sake. But that's not my point. There is  definite chicken and egg problem here, where not enough people know who you are and what you are doing to make virtually any production pay for itself, let alone make you money (never mind "real" money). The lesson I'd take away from what he did was how much of the work he did himself. Something that the super powerful computers sitting on many of our desks make possible. Look at what people are accomplishing by mastering their craft, and then how relatively little technology it takes to get an amazing recording on the 'Nets for all to enjoy. And think about it. He could have walked away with nothing (or less than nothing) for his efforts too.]</cite> <br />

<blockquote>
  <p>When the security issue was brought up, Rep. Mel Watt of North Carolina seemed particularly comfortable about his own lack of understanding. Grinningly admitting “I’m not a nerd” before the committee, he nevertheless went on to dismiss without facts or justification the very evidence he didn’t understand and then downplay the need for a panel of experts. Rep. Maxine Waters of California followed up by saying that any discussion of security concerns is “wasting time” and that the bill should move forward without question, busted internets be damned.</p>

<p>Bipartisan willful ignorance.</p>

<a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/10/25/3-misconceptions-that-need-to-die.aspx">3 Misconceptions That Need to Die (WMT, X)</a>: <blockquote>At a conference in Philadelphia earlier this month, a Wharton professor noted that one of the country's biggest economic problems is a tsunami of misinformation. You can't have a rational debate when facts are so easily supplanted by overreaching statements, broad generalizations, and misconceptions. And if you can't have a rational debate, how does anything important get done? As author William Feather once advised, "Beware of the person who can't be bothered by details." There seems to be no shortage of those people lately.</blockquote><cite title="Daniel's remark..." class="dRemark">[1) Misconception: Most of what Americans spend their money on is made in China. 2) Misconception: We owe most of our debt to China. 3)Misconception: We get most of our oil from the Middle East. Now tell me you weren't surprised at, if nothing else, how pervasive things like this are without facts. Shoddy reporting and willful suspension of disbelief will take us far down this awful road.]</cite>
